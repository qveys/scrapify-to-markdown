Large screen devices
====================

1. [UI](/ui) chevron\_right- [Adaptive design](/ui/adaptive-responsive) chevron\_right- [Large screens](/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screens)

This page provides guidance on optimizing your app to improve its behavior on large screens.

Flutter, like Android, defines [large screens](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/get-started-with-large-screens) as tablets, foldables, and ChromeOS devices running Android. Flutter *also* defines large screen devices as web, desktop, and iPads.

Why do large screens matter, in particular?

Demand for large screens continues to increase. As of January 2024, more than [270 million active large screen](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/get-started-with-large-screens) and foldable devices run on Android and more than [14.9 million iPad users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/299632/tablet-shipments-apple/).

When your app supports large screens, it also receives other benefits. Optimizing your app to fill the screen. For example, it:

* Improves your app's user engagement metrics.* Increases your app's visibility in the Play Store. Recent [Play Store updates](https://developer.android.com/2022/03/helping-users-discover-quality-apps-on.html) show ratings by device type and indicates when an app lacks large screen support.* Ensures that your app meets iPadOS submission guidelines and is [accepted in the App Store](https://developer.apple.com/ipados/submit/).

Layout with GridView
--------------------

[#](#layout-with-gridview)

Consider the following screenshots of an app. The app displays its UI in a `ListView`. The image on the left shows the app running on a mobile device. The image on the right shows the app running on a large screen device *before the advice on this page was applied*.

![Sample of large screen](/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screen.png)

This is not optimal.

The [Android Large Screen App Quality Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality) and the [iOS equivalent](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ipados) say that neither text nor boxes should take up the full screen width. How to solve this in an adaptive way?

A common solution uses `GridView`, as shown in the next section.

### GridView

[#](#gridview)

You can use the `GridView` widget to transform your existing `ListView` into more reasonably-sized items.

`GridView` is similar to the [`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html) widget, but instead of handling only a list of widgets arranged linearly, `GridView` can arrange widgets in a two-dimensional array.

`GridView` also has constructors that are similar to `ListView`. The `ListView` default constructor maps to `GridView.count`, and `ListView.builder` is similar to `GridView.builder`.

`GridView` has some additional constructors for more custom layouts. To learn more, visit the [`GridView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html) API page.

For example, if your original app used a `ListView.builder`, swap that out for a `GridView.builder`. If your app has a large number of items, it's recommended to use this builder constructor to only build the item widgets that are actually visible.

Most of the parameters in the constructor are the same between the two widgets, so it's a straightforward swap. However, you need to figure out what to set for the `gridDelegate`.

Flutter provides powerful premade `gridDelegates` that you can use, namely:

[`SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount-class.html): Lets you assign a specific number of columns to your grid. [`SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent-class.html): Lets you define a max item width.

Don't use the grid delegate for these classes that lets you set the column count directly and then hardcode the number of columns based on whether the device is a tablet, or whatever. The number of columns should be based on the size of the window and not the size of the physical device.

This distinction is important because many mobile devices support multi-window mode, which can cause your app to be rendered in a space smaller than the physical size of the display. Also, Flutter apps can run on web and desktop, which might be sized in many ways. **For this reason, use `MediaQuery` to get the app window size rather than the physical device size.**

### Other solutions

[#](#other-solutions)

Another way to approach these situations is to use the `maxWidth` property of `BoxConstraints`. This involves the following:

* Wrap the `GridView`in a `ConstrainedBox` and give it a `BoxConstraints` with a maximum width set.* Use a `Container` instead of a `ConstrainedBox` if you want other functionality like setting the background color.

For choosing the maximum width value, consider using the values recommended by Material 3 in the [Applying layout](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/applying-layout/window-size-classes) guide.

Foldables
---------

[#](#foldables)

As mentioned previously, Android and Flutter both recommend in their design guidance **not** to lock screen orientation, but some apps lock screen orientation anyway. Be aware that this can cause problems when running your app on a foldable device.

When running on a foldable, the app might look ok when the device is folded. But when unfolding, you might find the app letterboxed.

As described in the [SafeArea & MediaQuery](/ui/adaptive-responsive/safearea-mediaquery) page, letterboxing means that the app's window is locked to the center of the screen while the window is surrounded with black.

Why can this happen?

This can happen when using `MediaQuery` to figure out the window size for your app. When the device is folded, orientation is restricted to portrait mode. Under the hood, `setPreferredOrientations` causes Android to use a portrait compatibility mode and the app is displayed in a letterboxed state. In the letterboxed state, `MediaQuery` never receives the larger window size that allows the UI to expand.

You can solve this in one of two ways:

* Support all orientations.* Use the dimensions of the *physical display*. In fact, this is one of the *few* situations where you would use the physical display dimensions and *not* the window dimensions.

How to obtain the physical screen dimensions?

You can use the [`Display`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Display-class.html) API, introduced in Flutter 3.13, which contains the size, pixel ratio, and the refresh rate of the physical device.

The following sample code retrieves a `Display` object:

dart

```
/// AppState object.
ui.FlutterView? _view;

@override
void didChangeDependencies() {
  super.didChangeDependencies();
  _view = View.maybeOf(context);
}

void didChangeMetrics() {
  final ui.Display? display = _view?.display;
}
```

The important thing is to find the display of the view that you care about. This creates a forward-looking API that should handle current *and* future multi-display and multi-view devices.

Adaptive input
--------------

[#](#adaptive-input)

Adding support for more screens, also means expanding input controls.

Android guidelines describe three tiers of large format device support.

![3 tiers of large format device support](/assets/images/docs/ui/adaptive-responsive/large-screen-guidelines.png)

Tier 3, the lowest level of support, includes support for mouse and stylus input ([Material 3 guidelines](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screen-app-quality), [Apple guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ipados#Best-practices)).

If your app uses Material 3 and its buttons and selectors, then your app already has built-in support for various additional input states.

But what if you have a custom widget? Check out the [User input](/ui/adaptive-responsive/input) page for guidance on adding [input support for widgets](/ui/adaptive-responsive/input#custom-widgets).

### Navigation

[#](#navigation)

Navigation can create unique challenges when working with a variety of differently-sized devices. Generally, you want to switch between a [`BottomNavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html) and a [`NavigationRail`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationRail-class.html) depending on available screen space.

For more information (and corresponding example code), check out [Problem: Navigation rail](https://blog.flutter.dev/developing-flutter-apps-for-large-screens-53b7b0e17f10#:~:text=Problem%3A%20Navigation%20rail1), a section in the [Developing Flutter apps for Large screens](https://blog.flutter.dev/developing-flutter-apps-for-large-screens-53b7b0e17f10) article.
