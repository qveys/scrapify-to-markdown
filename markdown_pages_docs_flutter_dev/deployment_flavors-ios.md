Set up Flutter flavors for iOS and macOS
========================================

1. [Deployment](/deployment) chevron\_right- [Flavors (iOS and macOS)](/deployment/flavors-ios)

This guide shows you how to create Flutter flavors for an iOS or macOS app.

Overview
--------

[#](#overview)

A Flutter flavor is basically a collection of settings that define how a specific version of your app should be built and run. For example, a flavor could determine which icon, app name, API key, feature flag, and logging level is associated with a specific version of your app.

If you want to create Flutter flavors for an iOS app, you'll need to do so in Xcode. Xcode does not have a concept called "flavor". Instead, you'll need to set up something called a scheme and attach custom configurations to it.

The following illustrates an example of two Flutter flavors (staging, production) as Xcode schemes with custom Xcode configurations assigned to them:

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scheme Configurations for the scheme|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | staging Debug-staging  Profile-staging  Release-staging | production Debug-production  Profile-production  Release-production | | | | | |

Configure Xcode schemes
-----------------------

[#](#configure-xcode-schemes)

The following steps show how to configure two Xcode schemes called `staging` and `production` for your Flutter iOS project. You can also use these steps to set up a macOS project by replacing any reference to `iOS` with `macOS`.

For a seamless workflow, we've started with a new Flutter project called `flavors_example`, but you can always start with an existing project.

1. Create a new Flutter project called `flavors_example`.

   console

   ```
   flutter create flavors_example
   ```

   - Open the default Xcode workspace for the iOS version of the `flavors_example` project.

     console

     ```
     cd flavors_example && open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
     ```

     - Open the `flavors_example` project in the Xcode project navigator:
       * Open the **project navigator** (**View** > **Navigators** > **Project**).* In the **project navigator**, at the top, select **Runner**.- Create schemes in Xcode:
         * Open the **New Scheme** window (**Product > Scheme > New Scheme**).* In the **Target** field, select **Runner**.* In the **Name** box, enter `staging`.* Click **Okay** to add the new scheme.* Repeat the previous steps for a scheme called `production`.* When finished, check to make sure that you have the following schemes:

                     ![Schemes for Flutter flavors](/assets/images/docs/flavors/flavors-ios-schemes.png)

         *info* Note

         By default the new schemes are shared. The schemes must be shared for Flutter flavors to work properly. To double-check that sharing is enabled, open the **Manage Schemes** window (**Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes**) and make sure that the **Shared** checkbox to the right of your new scheme is checked.

         - Create configurations for the schemes in Xcode:
           * In the **project navigator**, select **Runner**.* In the main window under **PROJECT**, select **Runner**.* Open the **Info tab** if it isnâ€™t open.* Go to the **Configurations** section and add new `Debug` configurations.
                   + Click **+**, select **Duplicate "Debug" configuration**, and name the new configuration `Debug-staging`.+ Click **+**, select **Duplicate "Debug" configuration**, and name the new configuration `Debug-production`.* Repeat the previous step for the `Release` configurations and the `Profile` configurations.* When finished, check to make sure that you have the following configurations:

                       ![Scheme configurations for Flutter flavors](/assets/images/docs/flavors/flavors-ios-scheme-configurations.png)

           *info* Note

           The scheme name (example: `staging`) that is appended to a configuration name must be lowercase if you want to use it with the Flutter CLI command.

           *info* Note

           Your configurations should be based on your `Debug.xconfig`, `Profile.xcconfig`, and `Release.xcconfig` files, not the `Pods-Runner.xcconfigs` file. You can check this by expanding the configuration names in Xcode.

           - Assign the configurations to the schemes in Xcode:
             * Open the **Manage Schemes** window (**Product > Scheme > Manage Schemes**).* Select the `staging` scheme and edit it.* In the following tabs, update the **Build Configuration** field as follows:
                   + **Run**: `Debug-staging`+ **Test**: `Debug-staging`+ **Profile**: `Profile-staging`+ **Analyze**: `Debug-staging`+ **Archive**: `Release-staging`* Click **Close**.* Repeat the previous steps for the `production` scheme.- If you are working with a pre-existing Flutter project that has at least one Podfile, update it. For more information, see [Update Podfiles](#update-podfiles).- To make sure that you've set up everything correctly, run your app on the new schemes in Xcode. You won't see any differences because the configuration settings haven't changed, but you do want to make sure that the app can run.
                 * Select the `staging` scheme (**Product > Schemes > staging**).* To the right of `staging` in the toolbar, select the iOS device you want to test against. In the following example, the device is `iPhone 16 Pro`.

                     ![Run a Flutter flavor](/assets/images/docs/flavors/flavors-ios-test-scheme.png)* Run the app scheme (**Product > Run**).* Repeat the previous steps for the `production` scheme.- If everything runs, you're ready to customize your configurations. For more information, see [Customize configurations](#customize-configurations).

Launch an Xcode scheme
----------------------

[#](#launch-an-xcode-scheme)

After you've created the schemes for an iOS app in Xcode, you can launch a specific scheme through Xcode or Flutter. You can also use these steps to launch a macOS project by replacing any reference to `iOS` with `macOS`.

### Use the flavor flag (Flutter CLI)

[#](#use-the-flavor-flag-flutter-cli)

You can launch an Xcode scheme in `Debug` mode with the Flutter CLI using the following steps:

1. In your IDE, start the iOS simulator.- In the console, navigate to the `flavors_example` directory and enter the following command:

     console

     ```
     flutter run --flavor <xcode_scheme_name>
     ```

     * `<xcode_scheme_name>`: Replace this with the name of your Xcode scheme (for example, `staging` or `production`).

     Example:

     console

     ```
     flutter run --flavor staging
     ```

### Use the run command (Xcode)

[#](#use-the-run-command-xcode)

You can launch a specific scheme in Xcode using the following steps:

1. Select the scheme you want to test (**Product > Schemes > Choose scheme**).- Next to the scheme name in the toolbar, select the device you want to test against.- Run the scheme for your app (**Product > Run**).

Customize configurations
------------------------

[#](#customize-configurations)

After you've added Xcode schemes, you can customize them for your iOS app. You can also use these steps to configure a macOS project by replacing any reference to `iOS` with `macOS`.

### Create distinct app display names

[#](#create_a_distinct_app_display_name)

If you have multiple schemes, a distinct app name can quickly identify which scheme your deployed app is using.

![Rename a Flutter flavor](/assets/images/docs/flavors/flavors-ios-app-names.png)

The following steps show how to add distinct app display names in Xcode for two schemes called `staging` and `production` in a project called `flavors_example`.

1. Create user-defined settings in Xcode:
   * Open the **project navigator** (**View > Navigators > Project**).* In the **project navigator**, at the top, select **Runner**.* In the main window under **TARGETS**, select **Runner**.* Open the **Build Settings** tab.* To the left of the Basic tab, click **+** and select **Add User-Defined Setting**.* Create a setting named `APP_DISPLAY_NAME`.* Expand the **APP\_DISPLAY\_NAME** setting.* Assign the following values to the following keys:
                   + **Debug-production**: `Flavors prod`+ **Debug-staging**: `Flavors staging`+ **Profile-production**: `Flavors prod`+ **Profile-staging**: `Flavors staging`+ **Release-production**: `Flavors prod`+ **Release-staging**: `Flavors staging`- Update `Info.plist` in Xcode:
     * In the project navigator, select **Runner > Runner > Info** to open `flavor_test/ios/Runner/Info.plist`.* Under **Information Property List**, find the following key and update the value for it:
         + **Key**: `CFBundleDisplayName`+ **Value**: `$(APP_DISPLAY_NAME)`- Launch the app for each scheme (`staging`, `production`) and check to make sure that the app display name has changed for each. To launch a scheme, see the steps in [Launch an Xcode scheme](#launch-an-xcode-scheme).

### Create distinct icons

[#](#create-distinct-icons)

If you have multiple schemes, a distinct icon for each configuration can help you quickly identify which scheme your deployed app is using.

![Rename a Flutter flavor](/assets/images/docs/flavors/flavors-ios-icons.png)

The following steps show how to add a distinct icon in Xcode for two schemes called `staging` and `production` in an iOS project called `flavors_example`.

1. Prepare your icons:
   * Design your staging icon and production icon in the design tool of your choice.* Generate versions of the staging icon and production icon in the sizes that you need. Save them in PNG format.

       *info* Note

       You can use a tool like [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/) to generate the versions of your icons.- Add the icons to your Xcode project:
     * Open the **project navigator** (**View > Navigators > Project**).* In the **project navigator**, select **Runner > Runner > Assets** to open the **Assets** window.* Complete the following steps for the staging icon:
           + Click **+ > iOS > iOS App icon**.+ Name the icon `AppIcon-staging`.+ Drag your staging icons into the **AppIcon-staging** window and make sure the icons are assigned to the correct sizes.* Repeat the previous step for the production icon.- Connect the icons to your schemes:
       * Open the **project navigator**.* In the main window under **TARGETS**, select **Runner**.* Open the **General** tab if it's not already open.* Go to the **Apps Icons and Launch Screen** section and expand it.* To the right of the **App icon** field, click **+** and update the fields as follows:
                 + **Debug-staging**: `AppIcon-staging`+ **Profile-staging**: `AppIcon-staging`+ **Release-staging**: `AppIcon-staging`+ **Debug-production**: `AppIcon-production`+ **Profile-production**: `AppIcon-production`+ **Release-production**: `AppIcon-production`- Launch the app for each scheme (`staging`, `production`) and check to make sure that the app icon has changed for each. To launch a scheme, see the steps in [Launch an Xcode scheme](#launch-an-xcode-scheme).

### Add distinct bundle identifiers

[#](#add-distinct-bundle-identifiers)

A bundle identifier is a unique identifier for your application on Apple's platforms. If you are using multiple Xcode schemes as Flutter flavors, you can have Apple treat each scheme as a separate application. To do this, you need to assign a different bundle identifier to each scheme. This allows you to test new features or bug fixes in one version of the app (for example `staging`) without affecting another version of the app (for example, `production`).

The following steps show how to set a unique bundle identifier for two Xcode schemes called `staging` and `production` in an iOS project called `flavors_example`.

1. In Xcode, open the **project navigator** (**View > Navigators > Project**).- In the main window under **TARGETS**, select **Runner**.- Open the **Build Settings** tab.- Navigate to the **Packaging** section.- Expand the **Product Bundle Identifier** setting to see the different build configurations.- For each scheme's build configuration, set the desired bundle identifier. For example:
             * Debug-staging, Profile-staging, Release-staging:

               `com.example.flavorsExample.staging`* Debug, Profile, Release, Debug-production, Profile-production, Release-production:

                 `com.example.flavorsExample`- Ensure that these bundle identifiers are included in your App ID and your App ID is [registered in your Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/identifiers/register-an-app-id/).

### Bundle assets

[#](#bundle-assets)

If you have assets that are only used in a specific flavor in your app, you can configure them to only be bundled into your app when launching that flavor. This prevents your app bundle size from being bloated by unused assets. To bundle assets for each flavor, add the `flavors` subfield to the `assets` field in your project's pubspec. To learn more, see the [`assets` field](/tools/pubspec#assets) in [Flutter pubspec options](/tools/pubspec).

### Update Podfiles

[#](#update-podfiles)

If you are creating new Xcode schemes for a Flutter iOS project and you have an iOS Podfile in an existing Flutter project, you must update the Flutter iOS Podfile to match the changes you made in Xcode.

The following steps show how to update your iOS Podfile to include two new Xcode schemes called `staging` and `production` in a Flutter project called `flavors_example`. You can also use these steps to update a macOS project by replacing any reference to `iOS` with `macOS`.

1. In your IDE, open the `ios/Podfile` file.- Make the following updates and save your changes.

     flavors\_example/ios/Podfile

     ruby

     ```
     project 'Runner', {
       ...
       'Debug' => :debug,
       'Debug-staging' => :debug,
       'Debug-production' => :debug,
       'Profile' => :release,
       'Profile-staging' => :release,
       'Profile-production' => :release,
       'Release' => :release,
       'Release-staging' => :release,
       'Release-production' => :release,
       ...
     ```

### Add unique build settings

[#](#add-unique-build-settings)

You can use [build settings](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/build-settings-reference/) to govern your iOS build process from compilation and linking to debugging and distribution. One way that you can use build settings with Flutter flavors is to assign those build settings to Xcode build configurations. For example, you might want to assign different API URLs to `Debug-staging` and `Debug-production`. For example:

debug-staging-settings.xcconfig

```
# Debug-staging build settings
API_BASE_URL = staging.flavors.com/api
```

debug-production-settings.xcconfig

```
# Debug-production build settings
API_BASE_URL = flavors.com/api
```

If you would like to add additional build settings for a specific build configuration, see Apple's [Adding a build configuration file to your project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-a-build-configuration-file-to-your-project).

### Add additional customizations

[#](#add-additional-customizations)

This document contains a few common Xcode scheme configurations, but there are many more that you can apply. To learn about them, see [Customizing the build schemes for a project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project).
