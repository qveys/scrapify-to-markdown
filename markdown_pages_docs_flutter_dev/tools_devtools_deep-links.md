*info* Note

As of release 3.27, the deep link validator tool works for *both* Android and iOS.

To see a demo of the deep link validator, check out the Google I/O 2024 video, [No more broken links: Deep linking success in Flutter](https://youtube.com/watch?v=d7sZL6h1Elw).

The deep link view validates any deep links that are defined in your app.

To use this feature, open DevTools, click into the **Deep Links** tab, and import a Flutter project that contains deep links.

This tool helps you identify and troubleshoot any errors in your mobile deep link setup, from website configuration to manifest files. DevTools provides instructions on how to fix any issues, making the implementation process easier.
