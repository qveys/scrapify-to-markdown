An introduction to widget testing
=================================

1. [Cookbook](/cookbook) chevron\_right- [Testing](/cookbook/testing) chevron\_right- [Widget](/cookbook/testing/widget) chevron\_right- [Introduction](/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction)

In the [introduction to unit testing](/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction) recipe, you learned how to test Dart classes using the `test` package. To test widget classes, you need a few additional tools provided by the [`flutter_test`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html) package, which ships with the Flutter SDK.

The `flutter_test` package provides the following tools for testing widgets:

* The [`WidgetTester`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester-class.html) allows building and interacting with widgets in a test environment.* The [`testWidgets()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/testWidgets.html) function automatically creates a new `WidgetTester` for each test case, and is used in place of the normal `test()` function.* The [`Finder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/Finder-class.html) classes allow searching for widgets in the test environment.* Widget-specific [`Matcher`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/package-matcher_matcher/Matcher-class.html) constants help verify whether a `Finder` locates a widget or multiple widgets in the test environment.

If this sounds overwhelming, don't worry. Learn how all of these pieces fit together throughout this recipe, which uses the following steps:

1. Add the `flutter_test` dependency.- Create a widget to test.- Create a `testWidgets` test.- Build the widget using the `WidgetTester`.- Search for the widget using a `Finder`.- Verify the widget using a `Matcher`.

1. Add the `flutter_test` dependency
------------------------------------

[#](#1-add-the-flutter_test-dependency)

Before writing tests, include the `flutter_test` dependency in the `dev_dependencies` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file. If creating a new Flutter project with the command line tools or a code editor, this dependency should already be in place.

yaml

```
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

2. Create a widget to test
--------------------------

[#](#2-create-a-widget-to-test)

Next, create a widget for testing. For this recipe, create a widget that displays a `title` and `message`.

dart

```
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key, required this.title, required this.message});

  final String title;
  final String message;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
        body: Center(child: Text(message)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

3. Create a `testWidgets` test
------------------------------

[#](#3-create-a-testwidgets-test)

With a widget to test, begin by writing your first test. Use the [`testWidgets()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/testWidgets.html) function provided by the `flutter_test` package to define a test. The `testWidgets` function allows you to define a widget test and creates a `WidgetTester` to work with.

This test verifies that `MyWidget` displays a given title and message. It is titled accordingly, and it will be populated in the next section.

dart

```
void main() {
  // Define a test. The TestWidgets function also provides a WidgetTester
  // to work with. The WidgetTester allows you to build and interact
  // with widgets in the test environment.
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    // Test code goes here.
  });
}
```

4. Build the widget using the `WidgetTester`
--------------------------------------------

[#](#4-build-the-widget-using-the-widgettester)

Next, build `MyWidget` inside the test environment by using the [`pumpWidget()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester/pumpWidget.html) method provided by `WidgetTester`. The `pumpWidget` method builds and renders the provided widget.

Create a `MyWidget` instance that displays "T" as the title and "M" as the message.

dart

```
void main() {
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    // Create the widget by telling the tester to build it.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));
  });
}
```

### Notes about the pump() methods

[#](#notes-about-the-pump-methods)

After the initial call to `pumpWidget()`, the `WidgetTester` provides additional ways to rebuild the same widget. This is useful if you're working with a `StatefulWidget` or animations.

For example, tapping a button calls `setState()`, but Flutter won't automatically rebuild your widget in the test environment. Use one of the following methods to ask Flutter to rebuild the widget.

[`tester.pump(Duration duration)`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/TestWidgetsFlutterBinding/pump.html): Schedules a frame and triggers a rebuild of the widget. If a `Duration` is specified, it advances the clock by that amount and schedules a frame. It does not schedule multiple frames even if the duration is longer than a single frame.

*info* Note

To kick off the animation, you need to call `pump()` once (with no duration specified) to start the ticker. Without it, the animation does not start.

[`tester.pumpAndSettle()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester/pumpAndSettle.html): Repeatedly calls `pump()` with the given duration until there are no longer any frames scheduled. This, essentially, waits for all animations to complete.

These methods provide fine-grained control over the build lifecycle, which is particularly useful while testing.

5. Search for our widget using a `Finder`
-----------------------------------------

[#](#5-search-for-our-widget-using-a-finder)

With a widget in the test environment, search through the widget tree for the `title` and `message` Text widgets using a `Finder`. This allows verification that the widgets are being displayed correctly.

For this purpose, use the top-level [`find()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/find-constant.html) method provided by the `flutter_test` package to create the `Finders`. Since you know you're looking for `Text` widgets, use the [`find.text()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/CommonFinders/text.html) method.

For more information about `Finder` classes, see the [Finding widgets in a widget test](/cookbook/testing/widget/finders) recipe.

dart

```
void main() {
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));

    // Create the Finders.
    final titleFinder = find.text('T');
    final messageFinder = find.text('M');
  });
}
```

6. Verify the widget using a `Matcher`
--------------------------------------

[#](#6-verify-the-widget-using-a-matcher)

Finally, verify the title and message `Text` widgets appear on screen using the `Matcher` constants provided by `flutter_test`. `Matcher` classes are a core part of the `test` package, and provide a common way to verify a given value meets expectations.

Ensure that the widgets appear on screen exactly one time. For this purpose, use the [`findsOneWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/findsOneWidget-constant.html) `Matcher`.

dart

```
void main() {
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));
    final titleFinder = find.text('T');
    final messageFinder = find.text('M');

    // Use the `findsOneWidget` matcher provided by flutter_test to verify
    // that the Text widgets appear exactly once in the widget tree.
    expect(titleFinder, findsOneWidget);
    expect(messageFinder, findsOneWidget);
  });
}
```

### Additional Matchers

[#](#additional-matchers)

In addition to `findsOneWidget`, `flutter_test` provides additional matchers for common cases.

[`findsNothing`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/findsNothing-constant.html): Verifies that no widgets are found. [`findsWidgets`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/findsWidgets-constant.html): Verifies that one or more widgets are found. [`findsNWidgets`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/findsNWidgets.html): Verifies that a specific number of widgets are found. [`matchesGoldenFile`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/matchesGoldenFile.html): Verifies that a widget's rendering matches a particular bitmap image ("golden file" testing).

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  // Define a test. The TestWidgets function also provides a WidgetTester

  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    // Create the widget by telling the tester to build it.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));

    // Create the Finders.
    final titleFinder = find.text('T');
    final messageFinder = find.text('M');

    // Use the `findsOneWidget` matcher provided by flutter_test to
    // verify that the Text widgets appear exactly once in the widget tree.
    expect(titleFinder, findsOneWidget);
    expect(messageFinder, findsOneWidget);
  });
}

  const MyWidget({super.key, required this.title, required this.message});

  final String title;
  final String message;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
        body: Center(child: Text(message)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
