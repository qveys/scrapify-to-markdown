Flutter editor support
======================

1. [Tools](/tools) chevron\_right- [Editors](/tools/editors)

You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) combined with Flutter's command-line tools.

The Flutter team recommends using an editor that supports a Flutter extension or plugin, like VS Code and Android Studio. These plugins provide code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, debug support, and much more.

Local editors
-------------

The Flutter team supports plugins for VS Code, Android Studio, and IntelliJ. The plugins provide extensive development and debugging support as well as deep integrations with the [Dart analyzer](https://dart.dev/tools/analysis) and [Dart and Flutter DevTools](/tools/devtools).

Online editors

You can quickly try Flutter online without any local setup with one of the following editors.

Other editors
-------------

You can develop Dart and Flutter apps using any other text editor and terminal.

Depending on the editor, you can integrate the Dart SDK's support for the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/main/pkg/analysis_server/tool/lsp_spec/README.md) and the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/third_party/pkg/dap/tool/README.md) to enable rich code editing and debugging features for both Dart and Flutter.
