Debug Flutter apps
==================

1. [Testing & debugging](/testing) chevron\_right- [Debug Flutter apps](/testing/debugging)

There's a wide variety of tools and features to help debug Flutter applications. Here are some of the available tools:

* [VS Code](/tools/vs-code#run-app-with-breakpoints) (recommended) and [Android Studio/IntelliJ](/tools/android-studio#run-app-with-breakpoints), (enabled with the Flutter and Dart plugins) support a built-in source-level debugger with the ability to set breakpoints, step through code, and examine values.* [DevTools](/tools/devtools), a suite of performance and profiling tools that run in a browser.* [Flutter inspector](/tools/devtools/inspector), a widget inspector available in DevTools, and also directly from Android Studio and IntelliJ (enabled with the Flutter plugin). The inspector allows you to examine a visual representation of the widget tree, inspect individual widgets and their property values, enable the performance overlay, and more.
