Of course, these pages don't constitute an exhaustive list of the things you might consider. The more operating systems, form factors, and input devices you support, the more difficult it becomes to spec out every permutation in design.

Taking time to learn basic usability principles as a developer empowers you to make better decisions, reduces back-and-forth iterations with design during production, and results in improved productivity with better outcomes.
