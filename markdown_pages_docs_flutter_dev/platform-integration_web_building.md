Building a web application with Flutter
=======================================

1. [Platform integration](/platform-integration) chevron\_right- [Web](/platform-integration/web) chevron\_right- [Web development](/platform-integration/web/building)

This page provides an overview of how to configure, run, and build a web application using Flutter.

Requirements
------------

[#](#requirements)

Before you can build a web application with Flutter, make sure that you have the [Flutter SDK](/get-started) and a web browser installed. See the [Set up web development for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/setup) instructions for details.

Set up a Flutter project
------------------------

[#](#set-up-a-flutter-project)

To set up your project, you can create a new Flutter project or add web support to an existing project.

### Create a new project

[#](#create-a-new-project)

To create a new app that includes web support, run the following command:

```
flutter create my_app
```

### Add web support to an existing project

[#](#add-web-support-to-an-existing-project)

If you already have a project, run the `flutter create` command in your project directory:

```
flutter create . --platforms web
```

This creates a `web/` directory containing the web assets used to bootstrap and run your Flutter app.

Run your app
------------

[#](#run-your-app)

See the following sections to run your app.

### Run your app from the command line

[#](#run-your-app-from-the-command-line)

Select [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as your app's target device to run and debug a Flutter web app:

```
flutter run -d chrome
```

You can also choose Chrome as a target device in your IDE.

If you prefer, you can use the `edge` device type on Windows, or use `web-server` to navigate to a local URL in the browser of your choice.

*info* Hot reload on the web

As of the Flutter 3.35 release, hot reload is enabled by default on the web. [Hot restart](/tools/hot-reload) is still available as well.

If you discover any issues we ask that you file a bug using our [Web Hot Reload issue template](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/new?template=5_web_hot_reload.yml). Note this is in the Dart SDK repository where it's easier for us to track issues. Known issues can be seen in the associated [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/dart-lang/projects/107/views/1).

### Run your app using WebAssembly

[#](#run-your-app-using-webassembly)

You can pass the `--wasm` flag to run your app using WebAssembly:

```
flutter run -d chrome --wasm
```

Flutter web offers multiple build modes and renderers. For more information, see [Web renderers](/platform-integration/web/renderers).

### Disable hot reload in VS Code

[#](#disable-hot-reload-in-vs-code)

To temporarily disable hot reload support from VS Code, update your [`launch.json` file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging-configuration) file with the flag `--no-web-experimental-hot-reload`.

```
"configurations": [
    ...
    {
      "name": "Flutter for web (hot reload disabled)",
      "type": "dart",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "lib/main.dart",
      "args": [
        "-d",
        "chrome",
        "--no-web-experimental-hot-reload",
      ]
    }
  ]
```

### Disable hot reload from the command line

[#](#disable-hot-reload-from-the-command-line)

If you use `flutter run` from the command line, you can temporarily disable hot reload on the web with the following command:

```
flutter run -d chrome --no-web-experimental-hot-reload
```

### Use hot reload in DartPad

[#](#use-hot-reload-in-dartpad)

Hot reload is also enabled in DartPad with a new "Reload" button. The feature is only available if Flutter is detected in the running application. You can begin a hot reloadable session by selecting a sample app provided by DartPad.

Build your app
--------------

[#](#build-your-app)

See the following sections to build your app.

### Build your app from the command line

[#](#build-your-app-from-the-command-line)

Run the following command to generate a release build:

```
flutter build web
```

### Build your app using WebAssembly

[#](#build-your-app-using-webassembly)

You can also pass the `--wasm` flag to build your app using WebAssembly:

```
flutter build web --wasm
```

This populates a `build/web` directory with built files, including an `assets` directory, which need to be served together.

To learn more about how to deploy these assets to the web, see [Build and release a web app](/deployment/web). For answers to other common questions, see the [Web FAQ](/platform-integration/web/faq).

Debugging
---------

[#](#debugging)

Use [Flutter DevTools](/tools/devtools) for the following tasks:

* [Debugging](/tools/devtools/debugger)* [Logging](/tools/devtools/logging)* [Running Flutter inspector](/tools/devtools/inspector)

Use [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) for the following tasks:

* [Generating event timeline](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/performance-reference)* [Analyzing performance](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance)â€”make sure to use a profile build

Testing
-------

[#](#testing)

Use [widget tests](/testing/overview#widget-tests) or integration tests. To learn more about running integration tests in a browser, see the [Integration testing](/testing/integration-tests#test-in-a-web-browser) page.
