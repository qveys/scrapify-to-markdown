Integrate a Flutter module into your iOS project
================================================

1. [Add to app](/add-to-app) chevron\_right- [Add Flutter to iOS](/add-to-app/ios) chevron\_right- [Integrate Flutter](/add-to-app/ios/project-setup)

Flutter UI components can be incrementally added into your existing iOS application as embedded frameworks. To embed Flutter in your existing application, consider one of the following three methods.

When you add Flutter to your existing iOS app, it [increases the size of your iOS app](/resources/faq#how-big-is-the-flutter-engine).

For examples using an app built with UIKit, see the iOS directories in the [add\_to\_app code samples](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/main/add_to_app). For an example using SwiftUI, consult the iOS directory in [News Feed App](https://github.com/flutter/put-flutter-to-work/tree/022208184ec2623af2d113d13d90e8e1ce722365).

Development system requirements
-------------------------------

[#](#development-system-requirements)

Flutter requires the latest version of Xcode and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

Create a Flutter module
-----------------------

[#](#create-a-flutter-module)

To embed Flutter into your existing application with any method, create a Flutter module first. Use the following command to create a Flutter module.

```
cd /path/to/my_flutter
flutter create --template module my_flutter
```

Flutter creates module project under `/path/to/my_flutter/`. If you use the [CocoaPods method](/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/?tab=embed-using-cocoapods), save the module in the same parent directory as your existing iOS app.

From the Flutter module directory, you can run the same `flutter` commands you would in any other Flutter project, like `flutter run` or `flutter build ios`. You can also run the module in [VS Code](/tools/vs-code) or [Android Studio/IntelliJ](/tools/android-studio) with the Flutter and Dart plugins. This project contains a single-view example version of your module before embedding it in your existing iOS app. This helps when testing the Flutter-only parts of your code.

Organize your module
--------------------

[#](#organize-your-module)

The `my_flutter` module directory structure resembles a typical Flutter app.

```
my_flutter/
├── .ios/
│   ├── Runner.xcworkspace
│   └── Flutter/podhelper.rb
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart
├── test/
└── pubspec.yaml
```

Your Dart code should be added to the `lib/` directory. Your Flutter dependencies, packages, and plugins must be added to the `pubspec.yaml` file.

The `.ios/` hidden subfolder contains an Xcode workspace where you can run a standalone version of your module. This wrapper project bootstraps your Flutter code. It contains helper scripts to facilitate building frameworks or embedding the module into your existing application with CocoaPods.

*info* Note

* Add custom iOS code to your own existing application's project or to a plugin, not to the module's `.ios/` directory. Changes made in your module's `.ios/` directory don't appear in your existing iOS project using the module, and might be overwritten by Flutter.* Exclude the `.ios/` directory from source control as it's autogenerated.* Before building the module on a new machine, run `flutter pub get` in the `my_flutter` directory. This regenerates the `.ios/` directory before building the iOS project that uses the Flutter module.

Embed a Flutter module in your iOS app
--------------------------------------

[#](#embed-a-flutter-module-in-your-ios-app)

After you have developed your Flutter module, you can embed it using the methods described in the table at the top of the page.

You can run in **Debug** mode on a simulator or a real device, and **Release** mode on a real device.

*info* Note

Learn more about [Flutter's build modes](/testing/build-modes).

To use Flutter debugging features such as hot reload, consult [Debugging your add-to-app module](/add-to-app/debugging/).

* [Use CocoaPods](#69-tab-panel)* [Use frameworks](#70-tab-panel)* [Use frameworks and CocoaPods](#71-tab-panel)

### Use CocoaPods and the Flutter SDK

[#](#method-a)

#### Approach

[#](#method-a-approach)

This first method uses CocoaPods to embed the Flutter modules. CocoaPods manages dependencies for Swift projects, including Flutter code and plugins. Each time Xcode builds the app, CocoaPods embeds the Flutter modules.

This allows rapid iteration with the most up-to-date version of your Flutter module without running additional commands outside of Xcode.

To learn more about CocoaPods, consult the [CocoaPods getting started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html).

#### Watch the video

[#](#watch-the-video)

If watching a video helps you learn, this video covers adding Flutter to an iOS app:

[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Step by step on how to add Flutter to an existing iOS app"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/IIcrfrTshTs)

#### Requirements

[#](#method-a-reqs)

Every developer working on your project must have a local version of the Flutter SDK and CocoaPods installed.

#### Example project structure

[#](#method-a-structure)

This section assumes that your existing app and the Flutter module reside in sibling directories. If you have a different directory structure, adjust the relative paths. The example directory structure resembles the following:

```
/path/to/MyApp
├── my_flutter/
│   └── .ios/
│       └── Flutter/
│         └── podhelper.rb
└── MyApp/
    └── Podfile
```

#### Update your Podfile

[#](#update-your-podfile)

Add your Flutter modules to your Podfile configuration file. This section presumes you called your Swift app `MyApp`.

1. *(Optional)* If your existing app lacks a `Podfile` config file, navigate to the root of your app directory. Use the `pod init` command to create the `Podfile` file.

   *lightbulb* Tip

   If the `pod init` command errors, check that you're on the latest version of CocoaPods.

   - Update your `Podfile` config file.
     1. Add the following lines after the `platform` declaration.

        MyApp/Podfile

        ruby

        ```
        flutter_application_path = '../my_flutter'
        load File.join(flutter_application_path, '.ios', 'Flutter', 'podhelper.rb')
        ```

        - For each [Podfile target](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#target) that needs to embed Flutter, add a call to the `install_all_flutter_pods(flutter_application_path)` method. Add these calls after the settings in the previous step.

          MyApp/Podfile

          ruby

          ```
          target 'MyApp' do
            install_all_flutter_pods(flutter_application_path)
          end
          ```

          - In the `Podfile`'s `post_install` block, add a call to `flutter_post_install(installer)`. This block should be the last block in the `Podfile` config file.

            MyApp/Podfile

            ruby

            ```
            post_install do |installer|
              flutter_post_install(installer) if defined?(flutter_post_install)
            end
            ```

To review an example `Podfile`, consult this [Flutter Podfile sample](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/main/add_to_app/plugin/ios_using_plugin/Podfile).

#### Embed your frameworks

[#](#embed-your-frameworks)

At build time, Xcode packages your Dart code, each Flutter plugin, and the Flutter engine into their own `*.xcframework` bundles. CocoaPod's `podhelper.rb` script then embeds these `*.xcframework` bundles into your project.

* `Flutter.xcframework` contains the Flutter engine.* `App.xcframework` contains the compiled Dart code for this project.* `<plugin>.xcframework` contains one Flutter plugin.

To embed the Flutter engine, your Dart code, and your Flutter plugins into your iOS app, complete the following procedure.

1. Refresh your Flutter plugins.

   If you change the Flutter dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file, run `flutter pub get` in your Flutter module directory. This refreshes the list of plugins that the `podhelper.rb` script reads.

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

   - Embed the plugins and frameworks with CocoaPods.
     1. Navigate to your iOS app project at `/path/to/MyApp/MyApp`.- Use the `pod install` command.

          ```
          pod install
          ```

     Your iOS app's **Debug** and **Release** build configurations embed the corresponding [Flutter components for that build mode](/testing/build-modes).- Build the project.
       1. Open `MyApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

          Verify that you're opening `MyApp.xcworkspace` and not opening `MyApp.xcodeproj`. The `.xcworkspace` file has the CocoaPod dependencies, the `.xcodeproj` doesn't.- Select **Product** > **Build** or press `Cmd` + `B`.

#### Set LLDB Init File

[#](#set-lldb-init-file)

*warning* Warning

Set your scheme to use Flutter's LLDB Init File. Without this file, debugging on an iOS 26 or later device may crash.

1. Generate Flutter LLDB files.
   1. Within your flutter application, run the following:

   ```
   flutter build ios --config-only
   ```

   This will generate the LLDB files in the `.ios/Flutter/ephemeral` directory.- Set the LLDB Init File.
     1. Go to **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme**.- Select the **Run** section in the left side bar.- Set the **LLDB Init File** using the same relative path to your Flutter application as you put in your Podfile in the **Update your Podfile** section.

            ```
            $(SRCROOT)/../my_flutter/.ios/Flutter/ephemeral/flutter_lldbinit
            ```

            If your scheme already has an **LLDB Init File**, you can add Flutter's LLDB file to it. The path to Flutter's LLDB Init File must be relative to the location of your project's LLDB Init File.

            For example, if your LLDB file is located at `/path/to/MyApp/.lldbinit`, you would add the following:

            ```
            command source --relative-to-command-file "../my_flutter/.ios/Flutter/ephemeral/flutter_lldbinit"
            ```

### Link and Embed frameworks in Xcode

[#](#method-b)

#### Approach

[#](#method-b-approach)

In this second method, edit your existing Xcode project, generate the necessary frameworks, and embed them in your app. Flutter generates iOS frameworks for Flutter itself, for your compiled Dart code, and for each of your Flutter plugins. Embed these frameworks and update your existing application's build settings.

#### Requirements

[#](#method-b-reqs)

No additional software or hardware requirements are needed for this method. Use this method in the following use cases:

* Members of your team can't install the Flutter SDK and CocoaPods* You don't want to use CocoaPods as a dependency manager in existing iOS apps

#### Limitations

[#](#method-b-limits)

Flutter can't handle [common dependencies with xcframeworks](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/130220). If both the host app and the Flutter module's plugin define the same pod dependency and you integrate Flutter module using this option, errors result. These errors include issues like `Multiple commands produce 'CommonDependency.framework'`.

To work around this issue, link every plugin source in its `podspec` file from the Flutter module to the host app's `Podfile`. Link the source instead of the plugins' `xcframework` framework. The next section explains how to [produce that framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/114692).

To prevent the error that occurs when common dependencies exist, use `flutter build ios-framework` with the `--no-plugins` flag.

#### Example project structure

[#](#method-b-structure)

The following example assumes that you want to generate the frameworks to `/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/`.

```
flutter build ios-framework --output=/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/
```

Run this *every time* you change code in your Flutter module.

The resulting project structure should resemble this directory tree.

```
/path/to/MyApp/
└── Flutter/
    ├── Debug/
    │   ├── Flutter.xcframework
    │   ├── App.xcframework
    │   ├── FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework (only if you have plugins with iOS platform code)
    │   └── example_plugin.xcframework (each plugin is a separate framework)
    ├── Profile/
    │   ├── Flutter.xcframework
    │   ├── App.xcframework
    │   ├── FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework
    │   └── example_plugin.xcframework
    └── Release/
        ├── Flutter.xcframework
        ├── App.xcframework
        ├── FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework
        └── example_plugin.xcframework
```

*warning* Warning

Always use `Flutter.xcframework` and `App.xcframework` bundles located in the same directory. Mixing `.xcframework` imports from different directories (like `Profile/Flutter.xcframework` with `Debug/App.xcframework`) causes runtime crashes.

#### Procedures

[#](#procedures)

How you link, embed, or both the generated frameworks into your existing app in Xcode depends on the type of framework.

* Link and embed dynamic frameworks.* Link static frameworks. [Never embed them](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2435/_index.html).

Flutter plugins might produce [static or dynamic frameworks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32591878/ios-is-it-a-static-or-a-dynamic-framework). Link static frameworks, [*never* embed them](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2435/_index.html).

If you embed a static framework into your iOS app, you can't publish that app to the App Store. Publishing fails with a `Found an unexpected Mach-O header code` archive error.

##### Link all frameworks

[#](#link-all-frameworks)

To link the necessary frameworks, follow this procedure.

1. Choose the frameworks to link.
   1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.- Click the **Build Phases** tab.- Expand **Link Binary With Libraries**.

          ![Expand the **Link Binary With Libraries** build phase in Xcode](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/linked-libraries.png)Expand the **Link Binary With Libraries** build phase in Xcode- Click **+** (plus sign).- Click **Add Other...** then **Add Files...**.- From the **Choose frameworks and libraries to add:** dialog box, navigate to the `/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/Release/` directory.- Command-click the frameworks in that directory then click **Open**.

                    sourceTree = "<group>";
                  };
                  ```- Update the search paths.
       1. Click the **Build Settings** tab.- Navigate to **Search Paths**- Double-click to the right of **Framework Search Paths**.- In the combo box, click **+** (plus sign).- Type `$(inherited)`. and press `Enter`.- Click **+** (plus sign).- Type `$(PROJECT_DIR)/Flutter/$(CONFIGURATION)/` and press `Enter`.

After linking the frameworks, they should display in the **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section of your target's **General** settings.

##### Embed the dynamic frameworks

[#](#embed-the-dynamic-frameworks)

To embed your dynamic frameworks, complete the following procedure.

1. Navigate to **General** > **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.- Click on each of your dynamic frameworks and select **Embed & Sign**.

     ![Select **Embed & Sign** for each of your frameworks in Xcode](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/choose-to-embed.png)Select **Embed & Sign** for each of your frameworks in Xcode

     Don't include any static frameworks, including `FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework`.- Click the **Build Phases** tab.- Expand **Embed Frameworks**. Your dynamic frameworks should display in that section.

         ![The expanded **Embed Frameworks** build phase in Xcode](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/embed-xcode.png)The expanded **Embed Frameworks** build phase in Xcode- Build the project.
           1. Open `MyApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

              Verify that you're opening `MyApp.xcworkspace` and not opening `MyApp.xcodeproj`. The `.xcworkspace` file has the CocoaPod dependencies, the `.xcodeproj` doesn't.- Select **Product** > **Build** or press `Cmd` + `B`.

#### Set LLDB Init File

[#](#set-lldb-init-file-1)

*warning* Warning

Set your scheme to use Flutter's LLDB Init File. Without this file, debugging on an iOS 26 or later device may crash.

1. Generate Flutter LLDB files.
   1. Within your flutter application, re-run `flutter build ios-framework` if you haven't already:

   ```
   flutter build ios-framework --output=/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/
   ```

   This will generate the LLDB files in the `/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/` directory.- Set the LLDB Init File.
     1. Go to **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme**.- Select the **Run** section in the left side bar.- Set the **LLDB Init File** to the following:

            ```
            $(PROJECT_DIR)/Flutter/flutter_lldbinit
            ```

            If your scheme already has an **LLDB Init File**, you can add Flutter's LLDB file to it. The path to Flutter's LLDB Init File must be relative to the location of your project's LLDB Init File.

            For example, if your LLDB file is located at `/path/to/MyApp/.lldbinit`, you would add the following:

            ```
            command source --relative-to-command-file "Flutter/flutter_lldbinit"
            ```

### Use frameworks in Xcode and Flutter framework as podspec

[#](#method-c)

#### Approach

[#](#method-c-approach)

This method generates Flutter as a CocoaPods podspec instead of distributing the large `Flutter.xcframework` to other developers, machines, or continuous integration systems. Flutter still generates iOS frameworks for your compiled Dart code, and for each of your Flutter plugins. Embed these frameworks and update your existing application's build settings.

#### Requirements

[#](#method-c-reqs)

No additional software or hardware requirements are needed for this method. Use this method in the following use cases:

* Members of your team can't install the Flutter SDK and CocoaPods* You don't want to use CocoaPods as a dependency manager in existing iOS apps

#### Limitations

[#](#method-c-limits)

Flutter can't handle [common dependencies with xcframeworks](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/130220). If both the host app and the Flutter module's plugin define the same pod dependency and you integrate Flutter module using this option, errors result. These errors include issues like `Multiple commands produce 'CommonDependency.framework'`.

To work around this issue, link every plugin source in its `podspec` file from the Flutter module to the host app's `Podfile`. Link the source instead of the plugins' `xcframework` framework. The next section explains how to [produce that framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/114692).

To prevent the error that occurs when common dependencies exist, use `flutter build ios-framework` with the `--no-plugins` flag.

This method only works with the `beta` or `stable` [release channels](/install/upgrade#switching-flutter-channels).

#### Example project structure

[#](#method-c-structure)

The following example assumes that you want to generate the frameworks to `/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/`.

```
flutter build ios-framework --output=/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/
```

Run this *every time* you change code in your Flutter module.

The resulting project structure should resemble this directory tree.

```
/path/to/MyApp/
└── Flutter/
    ├── Debug/
    │   ├── Flutter.xcframework
    │   ├── App.xcframework

        ├── App.xcframework
        ├── FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework
        └── example_plugin.xcframework
```

*warning* Warning

Always use `Flutter.xcframework` and `App.xcframework` bundles located in the same directory. Mixing `.xcframework` imports from different directories (like `Profile/Flutter.xcframework` with `Debug/App.xcframework`) causes runtime crashes.

#### Add Flutter engine to your Podfile

[#](#add-flutter-engine-to-your-podfile)

Host apps using CocoaPods can add the Flutter engine to their Podfile.

MyApp/Podfile

ruby

```
pod 'Flutter', :podspec => '/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/[build mode]/Flutter.podspec'
```

*info* Note

You must hard code the `[build mode]` value. For example, use `Debug` if you need to use `flutter attach` and `Release` when you're ready to ship.

#### Link and embed app and plugin frameworks

[#](#link-and-embed-app-and-plugin-frameworks)

Flutter plugins might produce [static or dynamic frameworks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32591878/ios-is-it-a-static-or-a-dynamic-framework). Link static frameworks, [*never* embed them](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2435/_index.html).

After linking the frameworks, they should display in the **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section of your target's **General** settings.

##### Embed the dynamic frameworks

[#](#embed-the-dynamic-frameworks-1)

To embed your dynamic frameworks, complete the following procedure.

1. Navigate to **General** > **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.- Click on each of your dynamic frameworks and select **Embed & Sign**.

     ![Select **Embed & Sign** for each of your frameworks in Xcode](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/choose-to-embed.png)Select **Embed & Sign** for each of your frameworks in Xcode

     Don't include any static frameworks, including `FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework`.- Click the **Build Phases** tab.- Expand **Embed Frameworks**. Your dynamic frameworks should display in that section.

         ![The expanded **Embed Frameworks** build phase in Xcode](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/embed-xcode.png)The expanded **Embed Frameworks** build phase in Xcode- Build the project.
           1. Open `MyApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

              Verify that you're opening `MyApp.xcworkspace` and not opening `MyApp.xcodeproj`. The `.xcworkspace` file has the CocoaPod dependencies, the `.xcodeproj` doesn't.- Select **Product** > **Build** or press `Cmd` + `B`.

#### Set LLDB Init File

[#](#set-lldb-init-file-2)

*warning* Warning

Set your scheme to use Flutter's LLDB Init File. Without this file, debugging on an iOS 26 or later device may crash.

1. Generate Flutter LLDB files.
   1. Within your flutter application, re-run `flutter build ios-framework` if you haven't already:

   ```
   flutter build ios-framework --output=/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/
   ```

   This will generate the LLDB files in the `/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/` directory.- Set the LLDB Init File.
     1. Go to **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme**.- Select the **Run** section in the left side bar.- Set the **LLDB Init File** to the following:

            ```
            $(PROJECT_DIR)/Flutter/flutter_lldbinit
            ```

            If your scheme already has an **LLDB Init File**, you can add Flutter's LLDB file to it. The path to Flutter's LLDB Init File must be relative to the location of your project's LLDB Init File.

            For example, if your LLDB file is located at `/path/to/MyApp/.lldbinit`, you would add the following:

            ```
            command source --relative-to-command-file "Flutter/flutter_lldbinit"
            ```

Set local network privacy permissions
-------------------------------------

[#](#set-local-network-privacy-permissions)

On iOS 14 and later, enable the Dart multicast DNS service in the **Debug** version of your iOS app. This adds [debugging functionalities such as hot-reload and DevTools](/add-to-app/debugging) using `flutter attach`.

*warning* Warning

Never enable this service in the **Release** version of your app. The Apple App Store might reject your app.

To set local network privacy permissions only in the Debug version of your app, create a separate `Info.plist` per build configuration. SwiftUI projects start without an `Info.plist` file. If you need to create a property list, you can do so through Xcode or text editor. The following instructions assume the default **Debug** and **Release**. Adjust the names as needed depending on your app's build configurations.

1. Create a new property list.
   1. Open your project in Xcode.- In the **Project Navigator**, click on the project name.- From the **Targets** list in the Editor pane, click on your app.- Click the **Info** tab.- Expand **Custom iOS Target Properties**.- Right-click on the list and select **Add Row**.- From the dropdown menu, select **Bonjour Services**. This creates a new property list in the project directory called `Info`. This displays as `Info.plist` in the Finder.- Rename the `Info.plist` to `Info-Debug.plist`
     1. Click on **Info** file in the project list at the left.- In the **Identity and Type** panel at the right, change the **Name** from `Info.plist` to `Info-Debug.plist`.- Create a Release property list.
       1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on `Info-Debug.plist`.- Select **File** > **Duplicate...**.  
             You can also press `Cmd` + `Shift` + `S`.- In the dialog box, set the **Save As:** field to `Info-Release.plist` and click **Save**.- Add the necessary properties to the **Debug** property list.
         1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on `Info-Debug.plist`.- Add the String value `_dartVmService._tcp` to the **Bonjour Services** array.- *(Optional)* To set your desired customized permission dialog text, add the key **Privacy - Local Network Usage Description**.

                ![The `Info-Debug` property list with the **Bonjour Services** and **Privacy - Local Network Usage Description** keys added](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/debug-plist.png)The `Info-Debug` property list with the **Bonjour Services** and **Privacy - Local Network Usage Description** keys added- Set the target to use different property lists for different build modes.
           1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.- Click the **Build Settings** tab.- Click **All** and **Combined** sub-tabs.- In the Search box, type `plist`.  
                     This limits the settings to those that include property lists.- Scroll through the list until you see **Packaging**.- Click on the **Info.plist File** setting.- Change the **Info.plist File** value from `path/to/Info.plist` to `path/to/Info-$(CONFIGURATION).plist`.

                          ![Updating the `Info.plist` build setting to use build mode-specific property lists](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/set-plist-build-setting.png)Updating the `Info.plist` build setting to use build mode-specific property lists

                          This resolves to the path **Info-Debug.plist** in **Debug** and **Info-Release.plist** in **Release**.

                          ![The updated **Info.plist File** build setting displaying the configuration variations](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/plist-build-setting.png)The updated **Info.plist File** build setting displaying the configuration variations- Remove the **Release** property list from the **Build Phases**.
             1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.- Click the **Build Phases** tab.- Expand **Copy Bundle Resources**.- If this list includes `Info-Release.plist`, click on it and then click the **-** (minus sign) under it to remove the property list from the resources list.

                      ![The **Copy Bundle** build phase displaying the **Info-Release.plist** setting. Remove this setting.](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/copy-bundle.png)The **Copy Bundle** build phase displaying the **Info-Release.plist** setting. Remove this setting.- The first Flutter screen your Debug app loads prompts for local network permission.

               Click **OK**.

               *(Optional)* To grant permission before the app loads, enable **Settings > Privacy > Local Network > Your App**.

Mitigate known issue with Apple Silicon Macs
--------------------------------------------

[#](#mitigate-known-issue-with-apple-silicon-macs)

On [Macs running Apple Silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943), the host app builds for an `arm64` simulator. While Flutter supports `arm64` simulators, some plugins might not. If you use one of these plugins, you might see a compilation error like **Undefined symbols for architecture arm64**. If this occurs, exclude `arm64` from the simulator architectures in your host app.

1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.- Click the **Build Settings** tab.- Click **All** and **Combined** sub-tabs.- Under **Architectures**, click on **Excluded Architectures**.- Expand to see the available build configurations.- Click **Debug**.- Click the **+** (plus sign).- Select **iOS Simulator**.- Double-click in the value column for **Any iOS Simulator SDK**.- Click the **+** (plus sign).- Type `arm64` in the **Debug > Any iOS Simulator SDK** dialog box.

                       ![Add `arm64` as an excluded architecture for your app](/assets/images/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/excluded-archs.png)Add `arm64` as an excluded architecture for your app- Press `Esc` to close this dialog box.- Repeat these steps for the **Release** build mode.- Repeat for any iOS unit test targets.
