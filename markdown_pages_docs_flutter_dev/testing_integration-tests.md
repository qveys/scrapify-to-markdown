Check app functionality with an integration test
================================================

1. [Testing & debugging](/testing) chevron\_right- [Check app functionality with an integration test](/testing/integration-tests)

Introduction
------------

[#](#introduction)

This guide describes how to run integration tests with your Flutter app. With it, you'll learn how to do the following:

* Set up integration tests.* Verify if an app displays specific text.* Tap specific widgets.* Run integration tests.

The guide references the `counter_app` project that comes with Flutter and the Flutter [`integration_test`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/packages/integration_test#integration_test) package. The `integration_test` package lets you:

* Use the `flutter drive` command to run tests on a physical device or emulator.* Run on [Firebase Test Lab](https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab), to automate testing on a variety of devices.* Use [flutter\_test](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html) APIs to write tests in a style similar to [widget tests](/testing/overview#widget-tests).

Create a new app to test
------------------------

[#](#create-a-new-app-to-test)

Integration testing requires an app to test. This example uses the built-in **Counter App** example that Flutter produces when you run the `flutter create` command. The counter app allows a user to tap on a button to increase a counter.

1. To create an instance of the built-in Flutter app, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   flutter create counter_app
   ```

   - Change into the `counter_app` directory.- Open `lib/main.dart` in your preferred IDE.- Add a `key` parameter to the `floatingActionButton()` widget with an instance of a `Key` class with a string value of `increment`.

         dart

         ```
          floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
            key: const ValueKey('increment'),
            onPressed: _incrementCounter,
            tooltip: 'Increment',
            child: const Icon(Icons.add),
          ),
         ```

         - Save your `lib/main.dart` file.

After these changes, the `lib/main.dart` file should resemble the following code.

lib/main.dart

dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      title: 'Counter App',
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Counter App Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text(widget.title)),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            const Text('You have pushed the button this many times:'),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        // Provide a Key to this button. This allows finding this
        // specific button inside the test suite, and tapping it.
        key: const Key('increment'),
        onPressed: _incrementCounter,
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Add the `integration_test` dependency
-------------------------------------

[#](#add-the-integration_test-dependency)

You need to add the testing packages to your new app.

To add `integration_test` and `flutter_test` packages as `dev_dependencies` using `sdk: flutter`, run following command.

```
flutter pub add 'dev:integration_test:{"sdk":"flutter"}'
```

Output:

```

  # ... added dependencies
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^6.0.0
  integration_test:
    sdk: flutter
# ...
```

Create the integration test files
---------------------------------

[#](#create-the-integration-test-files)

Integration tests reside in a separate directory inside your Flutter project.

1. Create a new directory named `integration_test`.- Add empty file named `app_test.dart` in that directory.

The resulting directory tree should resemble the following:

```
counter_app/
  lib/
    main.dart
  integration_test/
    app_test.dart
```

Write the integration test
--------------------------

[#](#write-the-integration-test)

The integration test file consists of a Dart code file with dependencies on `integration_test`, `flutter_test`, and your app's Dart file.

1. Open your `integration_test/app_test.dart` file in your preferred IDE.- Copy the following code and paste it into your `integration_test/app_test.dart` file. The last import should point to the `main.dart` file of your `counter_app`. (This `import` points to the example app called `introduction`.)

     integration\_test/counter\_test.dart

     dart

     ```
     import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
     import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
     import 'package:how_to/main.dart';
     import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';

     void main() {
       IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

       group('end-to-end test', () {
         testWidgets('tap on the floating action button, verify counter', (
           tester,
         ) async {
           // Load app widget.
           await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

           // Verify the counter starts at 0.
           expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);

           // Finds the floating action button to tap on.
           final fab = find.byKey(const ValueKey('increment'));

           // Emulate a tap on the floating action button.
           await tester.tap(fab);

           // Trigger a frame.
           await tester.pumpAndSettle();

           // Verify the counter increments by 1.
           expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);
         });
       });
     }
     ```

This example goes through three steps:

1. Initialize `IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`. This singleton service executes tests on a physical device.- Interact and test widgets using the `WidgetTester` class.- Test the important scenarios.

Run integration tests
---------------------

[#](#run-integration-tests)

The integration tests that run vary depending on the platform on which you test.

* To test a desktop platform, use the command line or a CI system.* To test a mobile platform, use the command line or Firebase Test Lab.* To test in a web browser, use the command line.

---

### Test on a desktop platform

[#](#test-on-a-desktop-platform)

Expand if you test Linux apps using a CI system

To test a Linux app, your CI system must invoke an X server first. In the GitHub Action, GitLab Runner, or similar configuration file, set the integration test to work *with* the `xvfb-run` tool.

Doing this invokes an X Window system into which Flutter can launch and test your Linux app.

As an example using GitHub Actions, your `jobs.setup.steps` should include a step resembling the following:

yaml

```
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        uses: username/xvfb-action@v1.1.2
        with:
          run: flutter test integration_test -d linux -r github
```

This starts the integration test within an X Window.

If you don't configure your integration in this way, Flutter returns an error.

```
Building Linux application...
Error waiting for a debug connection: The log reader stopped unexpectedly, or never started.
```

To test on a macOS, Windows, or Linux platform, complete the following tasks.

1. Run the following command from the root of the project.

   ```
   flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
   ```

   - If offered a choice of platform to test, choose the desktop platform. Type `1` to choose the desktop platform.

Based on platform, the command result should resemble the following output.

* [Windows](#10-tab-panel)* [macOS](#11-tab-panel)* [Linux](#12-tab-panel)

```

### Test in a web browser

[#](#test-in-a-web-browser)

To test in a web browser, perform the following steps.

1. Install [ChromeDriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) into the directory of your choice.

   ```
   npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromedriver@stable
   ```

   To simplify the install, this command uses the [`@puppeteer/browsers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@puppeteer/browsers) Node library.- Add the path to ChromeDriver to your `$PATH` environment variable.- Verify the ChromeDriver install succeeded.

       ```
       chromedriver --version
       ChromeDriver 124.0.6367.60 (8771130bd84f76d855ae42fbe02752b03e352f17-refs/branch-heads/6367@{#798})
       ```

       - In your `counter_app` project directory, create a new directory named `test_driver`.

         ```
         mkdir test_driver
         ```

         - In this directory, create a new file named `integration_test.dart`.- Copy the following code and paste it into your `integration_test.dart` file.

             test\_driver/integration\_test.dart

             dart

             ```
             import 'package:integration_test/integration_test_driver.dart';

             Future<void> main() => integrationDriver();
             ```

             - Launch `chromedriver` as follows:

               ```
               chromedriver --port=4444
               ```

               - From the root of the project, run the following command:

                 ```
                 flutter drive \
                   --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
                   --target=integration_test/app_test.dart \
                   -d chrome
                 ```

                 The response should resemble the following output:
