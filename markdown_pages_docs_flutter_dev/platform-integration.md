Build for and integrate with multiple platforms
===============================================

1. [Platform integration](/platform-integration)

Flutter enables you to build, test, and deploy beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

Overview
--------

[#](#overview)

Flutter and its core packages often automatically support and integrate with Flutter's officially [supported platforms](/reference/supported-platforms). Some platforms require you to [set up additional tooling](#setup), but once your development environment is set up, Flutter apps are usually functional across platforms out of the box.

Occasionally you need to integrate with platform-specific functionality. For example, you might want to use a native library that's only available on iOS and iPadOS. For many use cases, you can find and use one of the many [Flutter plugins](/packages-and-plugins/using-packages) provided by the Flutter team and the amazing Flutter community. If none of them meet your needs, you can [write platform-specific code](/platform-integration/platform-channels) and even [create your own plugin](/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages).

*lightbulb* Tip

If you're exploring building your app for multiple platforms, also consider building your UI with [adaptive and responsive design](/ui/adaptive-responsive/) in mind.

Set up platform development
---------------------------

[#](#setup)

While Flutter apps can be built for a variety of [supported platforms](/reference/supported-platforms) with little to no modifications to your code, your development environment might require additional setup when targeting a new platform.

To set up development for an additional platform, select the platform from the following:

[Target Android On any device

Set up your development environment to build Flutter apps for Android.](/platform-integration/android/setup)[Target iOS On macOS only

Set up your development environment to build Flutter apps for iOS.](/platform-integration/ios/setup)[Target Web On any device

Set up your development environment to build Flutter apps for Windows.](/platform-integration/windows/setup)[Target macOS On macOS only

Set up your development environment to build Flutter apps for macOS.](/platform-integration/macos/setup)[Target Linux On Linux only
