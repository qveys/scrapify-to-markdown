flutter: The Flutter command-line tool
======================================

The `flutter` command-line tool is how developers (or IDEs on behalf of developers) interact with Flutter. For Dart related commands, you can use the [`dart`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-tool) command-line tool.

Here's how you might use the `flutter` tool to create, analyze, test, and run an app:

```
flutter create my_app
cd my_app
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run lib/main.dart
```

To run [`pub`](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-pub) commands using the `flutter` tool:

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub outdated
flutter pub upgrade
```

To view all commands that `flutter` supports:

```
flutter --help --verbose
```

To get the current version of the Flutter SDK, including its framework, engine, and tools:

```
flutter --version
```

The following table shows which commands you can use with the `flutter` tool:
