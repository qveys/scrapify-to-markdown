Get the Flutter SDK
-------------------

[#](#get-the-flutter-sdk)

### Unable to find the `flutter` command

[#](#unable-to-find-the-flutter-command)

**What does this issue look like?**

When you try to run the `flutter` command, the console fails to find it. The error usually looks as follows:

```
'flutter' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file
```

Error messages on macOS and Linux could look slightly different from the one on Windows.

**Explanation and suggestions**

Did you add Flutter to the `PATH` environment variable for your platform? On Windows, follow these [instructions for adding a command to your path](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-PATH-Environment-Variable-on-Windows).

If you've already [set up VS Code](/tools/vs-code#setup) for Flutter development, you can use the Flutter extension's **Locate SDK** prompt to identify the location of your `flutter` folder.

See also: [Configuring PATH and Environment Variables - Dart Code](https://dartcode.org/docs/configuring-path-and-environment-variables/)

### Flutter in special folders

[#](#flutter-in-special-folders)

**What does this issue look like?**

Running your Flutter project produces an error like the following:

```
The Flutter SDK is installed in a protected folder and may not function correctly.
Please move the SDK to a location that is user-writable without Administration permissions and restart.
```

**Explanation and suggestions**

On Windows, this usually happens when Flutter is installed in a directory like `C:\Program Files\` that requires elevated privileges. Try relocating Flutter to a different folder, such as `C:\src\flutter`.

Android setup

### Having multiple versions of Java installed

[#](#having-multiple-versions-of-java-installed)

**What does this issue look like?**

The command `flutter doctor --android-licenses` fails. Running `flutter doctor --verbose` gives an error message like the following:

```
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: com/android/prefs/AndroidLocationsProvider
has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 55.0),
this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 52.0
```

**Explanation and suggestions**

The error occurs when an older version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your computer.

If you don't need multiple versions of Java, uninstall existing JDKs from your computer. Flutter automatically uses the JDK included in Android Studio.

If you do need another version of Java, try the workaround described in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/106416#issuecomment-1522198064) until a long-term solution is implemented. For more information, check out the [Android Java Gradle migration guide](/release/breaking-changes/android-java-gradle-migration-guide) or [flutter doctor --android-licenses not working due to java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75328050/).

### `cmdline-tools` component is missing

[#](#cmdline-tools-component-is-missing)

**What does this issue look like?**

The `flutter doctor` command complains that the `cmdline-tools` are missing from the Android toolchain. For example:

```
[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 33.0.2)
    â€¢ Android SDK at C:\Users\My PC\AppData\Local\Android\sdk
    X cmdline-tools component is missing
```

**Explanation and suggestions**

The easiest way to get the cmdline-tools is through the SDK Manager in Android Studio. To do this, use the following instructions:

1. Open the SDK Manager from Android Studio by selecting **Tools > SDK Manager** from the menu bar.- Select the latest Android SDK (or a specific version that your app requires), Android SDK Command-line Tools, and Android SDK Build-Tools.- Click **Apply** to install the selected artifacts.

If you're not using Android Studio, you can download the tools using the [sdkmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager) command-line tool.

macOS setup
-----------

[#](#macos-setup)

### SocketException: Send failed, OS Error: No route to host, errno = 65

[#](#socketexception-send-failed-os-error-no-route-to-host-errno-65)

**What does this issue look like?**

On macOS, the `flutter run` command produces an error like:

```
$ flutter run
Launching lib/main.dart in debug mode...
...
Installing and launching...
Oops; flutter has exited unexpectedly: "SocketException: Send failed (OS Error: No route to host, errno = 65), address = 0.0.0.0, port = 5353".
```

**Explanation and suggestions**

This issue is related to macOS permissions.

To fix this:

1. Upgrade your Flutter SDK to the latest version.- Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Local Network**. Toggle on the permission for all the code editors and terminals you use to launch Flutter apps. You might need to restart your code editor, terminal, and physical device.

Other problems
--------------

[#](#other-problems)

### Exit code 69

[#](#exit-code-69)

**What does this issue look like?**

Running a `flutter` command produces an "exit code: 69" error, as shown in the following example:

```
Running "flutter pub get" in flutter_tools...
Resolving dependencies in .../flutter/packages/flutter_tools... (28.0s)
Got TLS error trying to find package test at https://pub.dev/.
pub get failed
command:
".../flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/
dart __deprecated_pub --color --directory
.../flutter/packages/flutter_tools get --example"
pub env: {
  "FLUTTER_ROOT": ".../flutter",
  "PUB_ENVIRONMENT": "flutter_cli:get",
  "PUB_CACHE": ".../.pub-cache",
}
exit code: 69
```

**Explanation and suggestions**

This issue is related to networking. Try the following instructions to troubleshoot:

* Check your internet connection. Make sure that you're connected to the internet and that your connection is stable.* Restart your devices, including your computer and networking equipment.* Use a VPN to help to bypass any restrictions that might prevent you from connecting to the network.* If you have tried all of these steps and are still getting the error, print out verbose logs with the `flutter doctor -v` command and ask for help in one of the [community support channels](#community-support).
