Use the Debug console
=====================

1. [Tools](/tools) chevron\_right- [Flutter and Dart DevTools](/tools/devtools) chevron\_right- [Use the Debug console](/tools/devtools/console)

The DevTools Debug console allows you to watch an application's standard output (`stdout`), evaluate expressions for a paused or running app in debug mode, and analyze inbound and outbound references for objects.

*info* Note

This page is up to date for DevTools 2.23.0.

The Debug console is available from the [Inspector](/tools/devtools/inspector), [Debugger](/tools/devtools/debugger), and [Memory](/tools/devtools/memory) views.

Watch application output
------------------------

[#](#watch-application-output)

The console shows the application's standard output (`stdout`):

Explore inspected widgets
-------------------------

[#](#explore-inspected-widgets)

If you click a widget on the **Inspector** screen, the variable for this widget displays in the **Console**:

Evaluate expressions
--------------------

[#](#evaluate-expressions)

In the console, you can evaluate expressions for a paused or running application, assuming that you are running your app in debug mode:

To assign an evaluated object to a variable, use `$0`, `$1` (through `$5`) in the form of `var x = $0`:

Browse heap snapshot
--------------------

[#](#browse-heap-snapshot)

To drop a variable to the console from a heap snapshot, do the following:

1. Navigate to **Devtools > Memory > Diff Snapshots**.- Record a memory heap snapshot.- Click on the context menu `[â‹®]` to view the number of **Instances** for the desired **Class**.- Select whether you want to store a single instance as a console variable, or whether you want to store *all* currently alive instances in the app.

The Console screen displays both live and static inbound and outbound references, as well as field values:
