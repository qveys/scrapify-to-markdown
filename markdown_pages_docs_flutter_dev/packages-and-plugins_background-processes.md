Background processes
====================

1. [Packages & plugins](/packages-and-plugins) chevron\_right- [Background processes](/packages-and-plugins/background-processes)

Have you ever wanted to execute Dart code in the backgroundâ€”even if your app wasn't the currently active app? Perhaps you wanted to implement a process that watches the time, or that catches camera movement. In Flutter, you can execute Dart code in the background.

The mechanism for this feature involves setting up an isolate. *Isolates* are Dart's model for multithreading, though an isolate differs from a conventional thread in that it doesn't share memory with the main program. You'll set up your isolate for background execution using callbacks and a callback dispatcher.

Additionally, the [WorkManager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager) plugin enables persistent background processing that keeps tasks scheduled through app restarts and system reboots.

For more information and a geofencing example that uses background execution of Dart code, see the Medium article by Ben Konyi, [Executing Dart in the Background with Flutter Plugins and Geofencing](https://blog.flutter.dev/executing-dart-in-the-background-with-flutter-plugins-and-geofencing-2b3e40a1a124). At the end of this article, you'll find links to example code, and relevant documentation for Dart, iOS, and Android.
