Flutter News Toolkit
====================

The Flutter News Toolkit enables you to accelerate development of a mobile news app. The toolkit assists you in building a customized template app with prebuilt features required for most news apps, such authentication and monetization. After generating your template app, your primary tasks are to connect to your data source, and to customize the UI to reflect your brand.

The Flutter News Toolkit includes critical features, such as:

* User onboarding* Account creation/login* Content feeds and content pages* Analytics* Notifications* Social sharing* Subscriptions* Ads

You can use these pre-integrated features out of the box, or modify and swap them with other functionality that you prefer.

Generating your template app requires answering a few simple questions, as described on the [Flutter News Toolkit Overview](https://flutter.github.io/news_toolkit/) doc page.

For complete documentation on how to configure your project, create a template app, develop the app, how to handle authentication, theming, work with an API server, and much more, check out the [Flutter News Toolkit](https://flutter.github.io/news_toolkit/) documentation.
