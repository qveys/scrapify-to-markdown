Introduction to animations
==========================

1. [UI](/ui) chevron\_right- [Animations](/ui/animations)

Well-designed animations make a UI feel more intuitive, contribute to the slick look and feel of a polished app, and improve the user experience. Flutter's animation support makes it easy to implement a variety of animation types. Many widgets, especially [Material widgets](/ui/widgets/material), come with the standard motion effects defined in their design spec, but it's also possible to customize these effects.

Choosing an approach
--------------------

[#](#choosing-an-approach)

There are different approaches you can take when creating animations in Flutter. Which approach is right for you? To help you decide, check out the video, [How to choose which Flutter Animation Widget is right for you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXIJJkq_H8g) (Also published as a [*companion article*](https://blog.flutter.dev/how-to-choose-which-flutter-animation-widget-is-right-for-you-79ecfb7e72b5).)

[Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "How to choose which Flutter animation widget is right for your use case"](https://www.youtube.com/watch/GXIJJkq_H8g)

(To dive deeper into the decision process, watch the [Animations in Flutter done right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnARLByOtKA&t=3s) video, presented at Flutter Europe.)

As shown in the video, the following decision tree helps you decide what approach to use when implementing a Flutter animation:

### Built-in implicit animations

[#](#built-in-implicit-animations)

To create an explicit animation (where you control the animation, rather than letting the framework control it), perhaps you can use one of the built-in explicit animations classes. For more information, watch [Making your first directional animations with built-in explicit animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CunyH6unILQ&list=PLjxrf2q8roU2v6UqYlt_KPaXlnjbYySua&index=3).

Animation types
---------------

[#](#animation-types)

Generally, animations are either tween- or physics-based. The following sections explain what these terms mean, and point you to resources where you can learn more.

### Tween animation

[#](#tween-animation)

Short for *in-betweening*. In a tween animation, the beginning and ending points are defined, as well as a timeline, and a curve that defines the timing and speed of the transition. The framework calculates how to transition from the beginning point to the end point.

* See the [Animations tutorial](/ui/animations/tutorial), which uses tweens in the examples.* Also see the API documentation for [`Tween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html), [`CurveTween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurveTween-class.html), and [`TweenSequence`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/TweenSequence-class.html).

### Physics-based animation

[#](#physics-based-animation)

In physics-based animation, motion is modeled to resemble real-world behavior. When you toss a ball, for example, where and when it lands depends on how fast it was tossed and how far it was from the ground. Similarly, dropping a ball attached to a spring falls (and bounces) differently than dropping a ball attached to a string.

* [Animate a widget using a physics simulation](/cookbook/animation/physics-simulation)  
   A recipe in the animations section of the Flutter cookbook.* Also see the API documentation for [`AnimationController.animateWith`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController/animateWith.html) and [`SpringSimulation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/physics/SpringSimulation-class.html).

Common animation patterns
-------------------------

[#](#common-animation-patterns)

Most UX or motion designers find that certain animation patterns are used repeatedly when designing a UI. This section lists some of the commonly used animation patterns, and tells you where to learn more.

### Animated list or grid

[#](#animated-list-or-grid)

This pattern involves animating the addition or removal of elements from a list or grid.

* [`AnimatedList` example](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/main/animations)  
   This demo, from the [Sample app catalog](https://github.com/flutter/samples), shows how to animate adding an element to a list, or removing a selected element. The internal Dart list is synced as the user modifies the list using the plus (+) and minus (-) buttons.

### Shared element transition

[#](#shared-element-transition)

In this pattern, the user selects an element—often an image—from the page, and the UI animates the selected element to a new page with more detail. In Flutter, you can easily implement shared element transitions between routes (pages) using the `Hero` widget.

* [Hero animations](/ui/animations/hero-animations) How to create two styles of Hero animations:
  + The hero flies from one page to another while changing position and size.+ The hero's boundary changes shape, from a circle to a square, as its flies from one page to another.* Also see the API documentation for the [`Hero`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Hero-class.html), [`Navigator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html), and [`PageRoute`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PageRoute-class.html) classes.

### Staggered animation

[#](#staggered-animation)

Animations that are broken into smaller motions, where some of the motion is delayed. The smaller animations might be sequential, or might partially or completely overlap.

* [Staggered Animations](/ui/animations/staggered-animations)

Essential animation concepts and classes
----------------------------------------

[#](#essential-animation-concepts-and-classes)

The animation system in Flutter is based on typed [`Animation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html) objects. Widgets can either incorporate these animations in their build functions directly by reading their current value and listening to their state changes or they can use the animations as the basis of more elaborate animations that they pass along to other widgets.

### Animation<double>

[#](#animationdouble)

In Flutter, an `Animation` object knows nothing about what is onscreen. An `Animation` is an abstract class that understands its current value and its state (completed or dismissed). One of the more commonly used animation types is `Animation<double>`.

An `Animation` object sequentially generates interpolated numbers between two values over a certain duration. The output of an `Animation` object might be linear, a curve, a step function, or any other mapping you can create. Depending on how the `Animation` object is controlled, it could run in reverse, or even switch directions in the middle.

Animations can also interpolate types other than double, such as `Animation<Color>` or `Animation<Size>`.

An `Animation` object has state. Its current value is always available in the `.value` member.

An `Animation` object knows nothing about rendering or `build()` functions.

### CurvedAnimation

[#](#curvedanimation)

A [`CurvedAnimation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurvedAnimation-class.html) defines the animation's progress as a non-linear curve.

dart

```
animation = CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn);
```

`CurvedAnimation` and `AnimationController` (described in the next sections) are both of type `Animation<double>`, so you can pass them interchangeably. The `CurvedAnimation` wraps the object it's modifying—you don't subclass `AnimationController` to implement a curve.

You can use [`Curves`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html) with `CurvedAnimation`. The `Curves` class defines many commonly used curves, or you can create your own. For example:

dart

```
import 'dart:math';

class ShakeCurve extends Curve {
  @override
  double transform(double t) => sin(t * pi * 2);
}
```

If you want to apply an animation curve to a `Tween`, consider using [`CurveTween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/CurveTween-class.html).

### AnimationController

[#](#animationcontroller)

[`AnimationController`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html) is a special `Animation` object that generates a new value whenever the hardware is ready for a new frame. By default, an `AnimationController` linearly produces the numbers from 0.0 to 1.0 during a given duration. For example, this code creates an `Animation` object, but does not start it running:

dart

```
controller = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
  vsync: this,
);
```

`AnimationController` derives from `Animation<double>`, so it can be used wherever an `Animation` object is needed. However, the `AnimationController` has additional methods to control the animation. For example, you start an animation with the `.forward()` method. The generation of numbers is tied to the screen refresh, so typically 60 numbers are generated per second. After each number is generated, each `Animation` object calls the attached `Listener` objects. To create a custom display list for each child, see [`RepaintBoundary`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RepaintBoundary-class.html).

When creating an `AnimationController`, you pass it a `vsync` argument. The presence of `vsync` prevents offscreen animations from consuming unnecessary resources. You can use your stateful object as the vsync by adding `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` to the class definition. You can see an example of this in [animate1](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/main/examples/animation/animate1) on GitHub.

*info* Note

In some cases, a position might exceed the `AnimationController`'s 0.0-1.0 range. For example, the `fling()` function allows you to provide velocity, force, and position (using the Force object). The position can be anything and so can be outside of the 0.0 to 1.0 range.

A `CurvedAnimation` can also exceed the 0.0 to 1.0 range, even if the `AnimationController` doesn't. Depending on the curve selected, the output of the `CurvedAnimation` can have a wider range than the input. For example, elastic curves such as `Curves.elasticIn` significantly overshoots or undershoots the default range.

### Tween

[#](#tween)

By default, the `AnimationController` object ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. If you need a different range or a different data type, you can use a [`Tween`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html) to configure an animation to interpolate to a different range or data type. For example, the following `Tween` goes from -200.0 to 0.0:

dart

```
tween = Tween<double>(begin: -200, end: 0);
```

A `Tween` is a stateless object that takes only `begin` and `end`. The sole job of a `Tween` is to define a mapping from an input range to an output range. The input range is commonly 0.0 to 1.0, but that's not a requirement.

A `Tween` inherits from `Animatable<T>`, not from `Animation<T>`. An `Animatable`, like `Animation`, doesn't have to output double. For example, `ColorTween` specifies a progression between two colors.

dart

```
colorTween = ColorTween(begin: Colors.transparent, end: Colors.black54);
```

A `Tween` object doesn't store any state. Instead, it provides the [`evaluate(Animation<double> animation)`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation/value.html) method that uses the `transform` function to map the current value of the animation (between 0.0 and 1.0), to the actual animation value.

The current value of the `Animation` object can be found in the `.value` method. The evaluate function also performs some housekeeping, such as ensuring that begin and end are returned when the animation values are 0.0 and 1.0, respectively.

#### Tween.animate

[#](#tween-animate)

To use a `Tween` object, call `animate()` on the `Tween`, passing in the controller object. For example, the following code generates the integer values from 0 to 255 over the course of 500 ms.

dart

```
AnimationController controller = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  vsync: this,
);
Animation<int> alpha = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(controller);
```

*info* Note

The `animate()` method returns an [`Animation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html), not an [`Animatable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animatable-class.html).

The following example shows a controller, a curve, and a `Tween`:

dart

```
AnimationController controller = AnimationController(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500),
  vsync: this,
);
final Animation<double> curve = CurvedAnimation(
  parent: controller,
  curve: Curves.easeOut,
);
Animation<int> alpha = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(curve);
```

### Animation notifications

[#](#animation-notifications)

An [`Animation`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html) object can have `Listener`s and `StatusListener`s, defined with `addListener()` and `addStatusListener()`. A `Listener` is called whenever the value of the animation changes. The most common behavior of a `Listener` is to call `setState()` to cause a rebuild. A `StatusListener` is called when an animation begins, ends, moves forward, or moves reverse, as defined by `AnimationStatus`.
