Supported deployment platforms
==============================

As of Flutter 3.35.1, Flutter supports deploying apps on the following combinations of hardware architectures and operating system versions. These combinations are called *platforms*.

Flutter categorizes platforms as follows:

* **Supported**: The platforms and versions that the Flutter team supports.* **CI-tested**: The Flutter team tests these platforms on every commit.* **Unsupported**: The Flutter team doesn't test or support these platforms.

Based on these categories, Flutter supports deploying to the following platforms.
