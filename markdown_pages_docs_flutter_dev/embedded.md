Embedded support for Flutter
============================

1. [Embedded support for Flutter](/embedded)

If you would like to embed Flutter engine into a car, a refrigerator, a thermostat... you CAN! For example, you might embed Flutter in the following situations:

* Using Flutter on an "embedded device", typically a low-powered hardware device such as a smart-display, a thermostat, or similar.* Embedding Flutter into a new operating system or environment, for example a new mobile platform or a new operating system.

The ability to embed Flutter, while stable, uses low-level API and is *not* for beginners. In addition to the resources listed below, you might consider joining [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/N7Yshp4), where Flutter developers (including Google engineers) discuss various aspects of Flutter. The Flutter [community](https://flutter.dev/community) page has info on more community resources.

* [Custom Flutter Engine Embedders](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/engine/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders.md), on the Flutter wiki.* The doc comments in the [Flutter engine `embedder.h` file](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/engine/src/flutter/shell/platform/embedder/embedder.h) on GitHub.* The [Flutter architectural overview](/resources/architectural-overview) on docs.flutter.dev.* A small, self-contained [Flutter Embedder Engine GLFW example](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/main/engine/src/flutter/examples/glfw#flutter-embedder-engine-glfw-example) in the Flutter engine GitHub repo.* An exploration into [embedding Flutter in a terminal](https://github.com/jiahaog/flt) by implementing Flutter's custom embedder API.* [Issue 31043](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31043): *Questions for porting flutter engine to a new os* might also be helpful.
