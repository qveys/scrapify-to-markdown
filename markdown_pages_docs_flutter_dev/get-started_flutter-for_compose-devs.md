Flutter for Jetpack Compose developers
======================================

1. [Get started](/get-started) chevron\_right- [Flutter for](/get-started/flutter-for) chevron\_right- [Flutter for Jetpack Compose developers](/get-started/flutter-for/compose-devs)

*info* Note

If you have experience building Android apps with Views (XML), check out [Flutter for Android developers](/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs).

Flutter is a framework for building cross-platform applications that uses the Dart programming language.

Your Jetpack Compose knowledge and experience are highly valuable when building with Flutter.

*lightbulb* Tip

To integrate Flutter code into an **existing** Android app, check out [Add Flutter to existing app](/add-to-app).

This document can be used as a reference by jumping around and finding questions that are most relevant to your needs. This guide embeds sample code. By using the "Open in DartPad" button that appears on hover or focus, you can open and run some of the examples on DartPad.

Overview
--------

[#](#overview)

Flutter and Jetpack Compose code describe how the UI looks and works. Developers call this type of code a *declarative framework*.

While there are key differences especially when it comes to interacting with legacy Android code, there are many commonalities between the two frameworks.

### Composables vs. Widgets

[#](#composables-vs-widgets)

**Jetpack Compose** represents UI components as *composable functions*, later noted in this document as *composables*. Composables can be altered or decorated through the use of *Modifier* objects.

kotlin

```
Text("Hello, World!", 
   modifier: Modifier.padding(10.dp)
)
Text("Hello, World!",
    modifier = Modifier.padding(10.dp))
```

**Flutter** represents UI components as *widgets*.

Both composables and widgets only exist until they need to change. These languages call this property *immutability*. Jetpack Compose modifies UI component properties using an optional *modifier* property backed by a `Modifier` object. By contrast, Flutter uses widgets for both UI components and their properties.

dart

```
Padding(                         // <-- This is a Widget
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(10.0), // <-- So is this
  child: Text("Hello, World!"),  // <-- This, too
)));
```

To compose layouts, both Jetpack Compose and Flutter nest UI components within one another. Jetpack Compose nests `Composables` while Flutter nests `Widgets`.

### Layout process

[#](#layout-process)

Jetpack Compose and Flutter handle layout in similar ways. Both of them lay out the UI in a single pass and parent elements provide layout constraints down to their children. More specifically,

1. The parent measures itself and its children recursively providing any constraints from the parent to the child.- The children try to size themselves using the above methods and provide their own children both their constraints and any that might apply from their ancestor nodes.- Upon encountering a leaf node (a node with no children), the size and properties are determined based on the provided constraints and the element is placed in the UI.- With all the children sized and placed, the root nodes can determine their measurement, size, and placement.

In both Jetpack Compose and Flutter, the parent component can override or constrain the child's desired size. The widget cannot have any size it wants. It also cannot *usually* know or decide its position on screen as its parent makes that decision.

To force a child widget to render at a specific size, the parent must set tight constraints. A constraint becomes tight when its constraint's minimum size value equals its maximum size value.

To learn how constraints work in Flutter, visit [Understanding constraints](/ui/layout/constraints).

### Design system

[#](#design-system)

Because Flutter targets multiple platforms, your app doesn't need to conform to any design system. While this guide features [Material](https://m3.material.io/develop/flutter/) widgets, your Flutter app can use many different design systems:

* Custom Material widgets* Community built widgets* Your own custom widgets

If you're looking for a great reference app that features a custom design system, check out [Wonderous](https://flutter.gskinner.com/wonderous/?utm_source=flutterdocs&utm_medium=docs).

UI basics
---------

[#](#ui-basics)

This section covers the basics of UI development in Flutter and how it compares to Jetpack Compose. This includes how to start developing your app, display static text, create buttons, react to on-press events, display lists, grids, and more.

### Getting started

[#](#getting-started)

For **Compose** apps, your main entry point will be *Activity* or one of its descendants, generally *ComponentActivity*.

kotlin

```
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        enableEdgeToEdge()
        setContent {
            SampleTheme {
                Scaffold(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { innerPadding ->
                    Greeting(
                        name = "Android",
                        modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

@Composable
fun Greeting(name: String, modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
    Text(
        text = "Hello $name!",
        modifier = modifier
    )
}
```

To start your **Flutter** app, pass an instance of your app to the `runApp` function.

dart

```
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

`App` is a widget. It's `build` method describes the part of the user interface it represents. It's common to begin your app with a [`WidgetApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsApp-class.html) class, like [`MaterialApp`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp-class.html).

dart

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}
```

The widget used in the `HomePage` might begin with the `Scaffold` class. `Scaffold` implements a basic layout structure for an app.

dart

```
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Hello, World!',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Note how Flutter uses the [`Center`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Center-class.html) widget.

Compose has a number of defaults from its ancestor Android Views. Unless otherwise specified, most components "wrap" their size to content meaning they only take up as much space as needed when rendered. That's not always the case with Flutter.

To center the text, wrap it in a `Center` widget. To learn about different widgets and their default behaviors, check out the [Widget catalog](/ui/widgets/layout).

### Adding Buttons

[#](#adding-buttons)

In **Compose**, you use the `Button` composable or one of its variants to create a button. `Button` is an alias for `FilledTonalButton` when using a Material theme.

kotlin

```
Button(onClick = {}) {
    Text("Do something")
}
```

To achieve the same result in **Flutter**, use the `FilledButton` class:

dart

```
FilledButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // This closure is called when your button is tapped.
  },
  const Text('Do something'),
),
```

**Flutter** gives you access to a variety of buttons with pre-defined styles.

### Aligning components horizontally or vertically

[#](#aligning-components-horizontally-or-vertically)

Jetpack Compose and Flutter handle horizontal and vertical collections of items similarly.

The following Compose snippet adds a globe image and text in both `Row` and `Column` containers with centering of the items:

kotlin

```
Row(horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.Center) {
   Image(Icons.Default.Public, contentDescription = "")
   Text("Hello, world!")
}

Column(verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center) {
   Image(Icons.Default.Public, contentDescription = "")
   Text("Hello, world!")
}
```

**Flutter** uses [`Row`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Row-class.html) and [`Column`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Column-class.html) as well but there are some slight differences for specifying child widgets and alignment. The following is equivalent to the Compose example.

dart

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    Icon(Icons.public),
    Text('Hello, world!'),
  ],
),

Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    Icon(MaterialIcons.globe),
    Text('Hello, world!'),
  ],
)
```

`Row` and `Column` require a `List<Widget>` in the `children` parameter. The `mainAxisAlignment` property tells Flutter how to position children with extra space. `MainAxisAlignment.center` positions children in the center of the main axis. For `Row`, the main axis is the horizontal axis, inversely for `Column`, the main axis is the vertical axis.

*info* note

Whereas Flutter's `Row` and `Column` have `MainAxisAlignment` and `CrossAxisAlignment` to control how items are placed, the properties that control placement in Jetpack Compose are one vertical and horizontal property from the following: `verticalArrangement`, `verticalAlignment`, `horizontalAlignment`, and `horizontalArrangement`. The trick to determine which is the `MainAxis` is to look for the property that ends in `arrangement`. The `CrossAxis` will be the property that ends in `alignment`.

### Displaying a list view

[#](#displaying-a-list-view)

In **Compose**, you have a couple ways to create a list based on the size of the list you need to display. For a small number of items that can all be displayed at once, you can iterate over a collection inside a `Column` or `Row`.

For a list with a large number of items, `LazyList` has better performance. It only lays out the components that will be visible versus all of them.

kotlin

```
data class Person(val name: String)

val people = arrayOf(
   Person(name = "Person 1"),
   Person(name = "Person 2"),
   Person(name = "Person 3")
)

@Composable
fun ListDemo(people: List<Person>) {
   Column {
      people.forEach {
         Text(it.name)
      }
   }
}

@Composable
fun ListDemo2(people: List<Person>) {
   LazyColumn {
      items(people) { person ->
         Text(person.name)
      }
   }
}
```

To lazily build a list in Flutter, ....

dart

```
class Person {
  String name;
  Person(this.name);
}

var items = [
  Person('Person 1'),
  Person('Person 2'),
  Person('Person 3'),
];

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: items.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text(items[index].name),
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Flutter has some conventions for lists:

* The [`ListView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html) widget has a builder method. This works like the `item` closure inside a Compose `LazyList`.* The `itemCount` parameter of the `ListView` sets how many items the `ListView` displays.* The `itemBuilder` has an index parameter that will be between zero and one less than itemCount.

The previous example returned a [`ListTile`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListTitle-class.html) widget for each item. The `ListTile` widget includes properties like `height` and `font-size`. These properties help build a list. However, Flutter allows you to return almost any widget that represents your data.

### Displaying a grid

[#](#displaying-a-grid)

Constructing a grid in **Compose** is similar to a LazyList (`LazyColumn` or `LazyRow`). You can use the same `items` closure. There are properties on each grid type to specify how to arrange the items, whether or not to use adaptive or fixed layout, amongst others.

kotlin

```
val widgets = arrayOf(
        "Row 1",
        Icons.Filled.ArrowDownward,
        Icons.Filled.ArrowUpward,
        "Row 2",
        Icons.Filled.ArrowDownward,
        Icons.Filled.ArrowUpward
    )

    LazyVerticalGrid (
        columns = GridCells.Fixed(3),
        contentPadding = PaddingValues(8.dp)
    ) {
        items(widgets) { i ->
            if (i is String) {
                Text(i)
            } else {
                Image(i as ImageVector, "")
            }
        }
    }
```

To display grids in **Flutter**, use the [`GridView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html) widget. This widget has various constructors. Each constructor has a similar goal, but uses different input parameters. The following example uses the `.builder()` initializer:

dart

```
const widgets = [
  Text('Row 1'),
  Icon(Icons.arrow_downward),
  Icon(Icons.arrow_upward),
  Text('Row 2'),
  Icon(Icons.arrow_downward),
  Icon(Icons.arrow_upward),
];

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: GridView.builder(
        gridDelegate: const SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
          crossAxisCount: 3,
          mainAxisExtent: 40,
        ),
        itemCount: widgets.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) => widgets[index],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount` delegate determines various parameters that the grid uses to lay out its components. This includes `crossAxisCount` that dictates the number of items displayed on each row.

Jetpack Compose's `LazyHorizontalGrid`, `LazyVerticalGrid`, and Flutter's `GridView` are somewhat similar. `GridView` uses a delegate to decide how the grid should lay out its components. The `rows`, `columns`, and other associated properties on `LazyHorizontalGrid` \ `LazyVerticalGrid` serve the same purpose.

### Creating a scroll view

[#](#creating-a-scroll-view)

`LazyColumn` and `LazyRow` in **Jetpack Compose** have built-in support for scrolling.

To create a scrolling view, **Flutter** uses [`SingleChildScrollView`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleChildScrollView-class.html). In the following example, the function `mockPerson` mocks instances of the `Person` class to create the custom `PersonView` widget.

dart

```
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: mockPersons
        .map(
          (person) => PersonView(
            person: person,
          ),
        )
        .toList(),
  ),
),
```

### Responsive and adaptive design

[#](#responsive-and-adaptive-design)

Adaptive Design in **Compose** is a complex topic with many viable solutions:

* Using a custom layout* Using `WindowSizeClass` alone* Using `BoxWithConstraints` to control what is shown based on available space* Using the Material 3 adaptive library that uses `WindowSizeClass` along with specialized composable layouts for common layouts

For that reason, you are encouraged to look into the **Flutter** options directly and see what fits your requirements versus attempting to find something that is a one to one translation.

To create relative views in **Flutter**, you can use one of two options:

* Get the `BoxConstraints` object in the [`LayoutBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html) class.* Use the [`MediaQuery.of()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MediaQuery-class.html) in your build functions to get the size and orientation of your current app.

To learn more, check out [Creating responsive and adaptive apps](/ui/adaptive-responsive).

### Managing state

[#](#managing-state)

**Compose** stores state with the `remember` API and descendants of the `MutableState` interface.

kotlin

```
Scaffold(
   content = { padding ->
      var _counter = remember {  mutableIntStateOf(0) }
      Column(horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,
         verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
         modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(padding)) {
            Text(_counter.value.toString())
            Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))
            FilledIconButton (onClick = { -> _counter.intValue += 1 }) {
               Text("+")
            }
      }
   }
)
```

**Flutter** manages local state using a [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html). Implement a stateful widget with the following two classes:

* a subclass of `StatefulWidget`* a subclass of `State`

The `State` object stores the widget's state. To change a widget's state, call `setState()` from the `State` subclass to tell the framework to redraw the widget.

The following example shows a part of a counter app:

dart

```
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key});
  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  int _counter = 0;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('$_counter'),
            TextButton(
              onPressed: () => setState(() {
                _counter++;
              }),
              child: const Text('+'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

To learn more ways to manage state, check out [State management](/data-and-backend/state-mgmt).

### Drawing on the Screen

[#](#drawing-on-the-screen)

In **Compose**, you use the `Canvas` composable to draw shapes, images, and text to the screen.

**Flutter** has an API based on the `Canvas` class, with two classes that help you draw:

1. [`CustomPaint`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomPaint-class.html) that requires a painter:

   dart

   ```
   CustomPaint(
     painter: SignaturePainter(_points),
     size: Size.infinite,
   ),
   ```

   - [`CustomPainter`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/CustomPainter-class.html) that implements your algorithm to draw to the canvas.

     dart

     ```
     class SignaturePainter extends CustomPainter {
       SignaturePainter(this.points);

       final List<Offset?> points;

       @override
       void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
         final Paint paint = Paint()
           ..color = Colors.black
           ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
           ..strokeWidth = 5;
         for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
           if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null) {
             canvas.drawLine(points[i]!, points[i + 1]!, paint);
           }
         }
       }

       @override
       bool shouldRepaint(SignaturePainter oldDelegate) =>
           oldDelegate.points != points;
     }
     ```

Themes, styles, and media
-------------------------

[#](#themes-styles-and-media)

You can style Flutter apps with little effort. Styling includes switching between light and dark themes, changing the design of your text and UI components, and more. This section covers how to style your apps.

### Using dark mode

[#](#using-dark-mode)

In **Compose**, you can control light and dark at any arbitrary level by wrapping a component with a `Theme` composable.

In **Flutter**, you can control light and dark mode at the app-level. To control the brightness mode, use the `theme` property of the `App` class:

dart

```
const MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ),
  home: HomePage(),
);
```

### Styling text

[#](#styling-text)

In **Compose**, you use the properties on `Text` for one or two attributes or construct a `TextStyle` object to set many at once.

kotlin

```
Text("Hello, world!", color = Color.Green,
        fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold, fontSize = 30.sp)
```

kotlin

```
Text("Hello, world!", 
   style = TextStyle(
      color = Color.Green, 
      fontSize = 30.sp, 
      fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold
   ),
)
```

To style text in **Flutter**, add a `TextStyle` widget as the value of the `style` parameter of the `Text` widget.

dart

```
Text(
  'Hello, world!',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 30,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
),
```

### Styling buttons

[#](#styling-buttons)

In **Compose**, you modify the colors of a button using the `colors` property. If left unmodified, they use the defaults from the current theme.

kotlin

```
Button(onClick = {},
   colors = ButtonDefaults.buttonColors().copy(
      containerColor = Color.Yellow, contentColor = Color.Blue,
       )) {
    Text("Do something", fontSize = 30.sp, fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold)
}
```

To style button widgets in **Flutter**, you similarly set the style of its child, or modify properties on the button itself.

dart

```
FilledButton(
  onPressed: (){},
  style: FilledButton.styleFrom(backgroundColor: Colors.amberAccent),
  child: const Text(
    'Do something',
    style: TextStyle(
      color: Colors.blue,
      fontSize: 30,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    )
  )
)
```

Bundling assets for use in Flutter
----------------------------------

[#](#bundling-assets-for-use-in-flutter)

There is commonly a need to bundle resources for use in your application. They can be animations, vector graphics, images, fonts, or other general files.

Unlike native Android apps that expect a set directory structure under `/res/<qualifier>/` where the qualifier could be indicating the type of file, a specific orientation, or android version, Flutter doesn't require a specific location as long as the referenced files are listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Below is an excerpt from a `pubspec.yaml` referencing several images and a font file.

yaml

```
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/my_icon.png
    - assets/background.png
  fonts:
    - family: FiraSans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/FiraSans-Regular.ttf
```

### Using fonts

[#](#using-fonts)

In **Compose**, you have two options for using fonts in your app. You can use a runtime service I to retrieve them [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Alternatively, they may be bundled in resource files.

**Flutter** has similar methods to use fonts, let's discuss them both inline.

### Using bundled fonts

[#](#using-bundled-fonts)

The following are roughly equivalent Compose and Flutter code for using a font file in the `/res/` or `fonts` directory as listed above.

kotlin

```
// Font files bundled with app
val firaSansFamily = FontFamily(
   Font(R.font.firasans_regular, FontWeight.Normal),
   // ...
)

// Usage
Text(text = "Compose", fontFamily = firaSansFamily, fontWeight = FontWeight.Normal)
```

dart

```
Text(
  'Flutter',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 40,
    fontFamily: 'FiraSans',
  ),
),
```

### Using a font provider (Google Fonts)

[#](#using-a-font-provider-google-fonts)

One point of difference is using fonts from a font provider like Google Fonts. In **Compose**, the instantiation is done inline with the same approximate code to reference a local file.

After instantiating a provider that references the special strings for the font service, you would use the same `FontFamily` declaration.

kotlin

```
// Font files bundled with app
val provider = GoogleFont.Provider(
    providerAuthority = "com.google.android.gms.fonts",
    providerPackage = "com.google.android.gms",
    certificates = R.array.com_google_android_gms_fonts_certs
)

val firaSansFamily = FontFamily(
    Font(
        googleFont = GoogleFont("FiraSans"),
        fontProvider = provider,
    )
)

// Usage
Text(text = "Compose", fontFamily = firaSansFamily, fontWeight = FontWeight.Light)
```

For Flutter, this is provided by the [google\_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) plugin using the name of the font.

dart

```
import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';
//...
Text(
  'Flutter',
  style: GoogleFonts.firaSans(),
  // or 
  //style: GoogleFonts.getFont('FiraSans')
),
```

### Using images

[#](#using-images)

In **Compose**, typically image files to the drawable directory in resources `/res/drawable` and one uses `Image` composable to display the images. Assets are referenced by using the resource locator in the style of `R.drawable.<file name>` without the file extension.

In **Flutter**, the resource location is a listed in `pubspec.yaml` as shown in the snippet below.

yaml

```
    flutter:
      assets:
        - images/Blueberries.jpg
```

After adding your image, you can display it using the `Image` widget's `.asset()` constructor. This constructor:
