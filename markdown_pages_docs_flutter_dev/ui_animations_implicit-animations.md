===================

1. [UI](/ui) chevron\_right- [Animations](/ui/animations) chevron\_right- [Implicit animations](/ui/animations/implicit-animations)

With Flutter's [animation library](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/animation-library.html), you can add motion and create visual effects for the widgets in your UI. One part of the library is an assortment of widgets that manage animations for you. These widgets are collectively referred to as *implicit animations*, or *implicitly animated widgets*, deriving their name from the [`ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget-class.html) class that they implement. The following set of resources provide many ways to learn about implicit animations in Flutter.
