Develop with Flutter
--------------------

[#](#develop-with-flutter)

Even just using Flutter and providing feedback is a valuable contribution!

### Provide feedback

[#](#provide-feedback)

Sharing your feedback and experiences helps the Flutter team understand and prioritize developer needs and pain points.

You can provide valuable feedback through many avenues, including:

* Upvoting existing issues

  If you're experiencing an issue that has already been reported, consider upvoting it to help the Flutter team understand its importance.

  Avoid otherwise empty thumbs up, +1, or similar comments. However, if you have additional information, such as reproduction steps or additional version information, do consider providing those details in a new comment.* Reporting new bugs

    If you experience a bug with Flutter that hasn't yet been reported, do [open a new issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new) with reproduction information.* Requesting features

      If there's a feature you think Flutter should add or implement but hasn't yet been suggested, do [open a new issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new) with all relevant information as well as your use case.* Partaking in surveys

        Occasionally, the Flutter team will run developer surveys and studies. To help understand pain points and improve the Flutter developer experience, consider responding with as much feedback and details as possible.

        To sign up for future UX research studies, visit [flutter.dev/research-signup](https://flutter.dev/research-signup).* Discussing proposals

          Major changes to Flutter are often discussed through [design documents](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/Design-Documents.md). Consider reading and providing feedback on proposals that are relevant to you or your apps.

          To find current design docs and proposals, check out [issues with the `design doc` label](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22design+doc%22) on the GitHub issue database.* Reviewing pull requests

            If you're familiar with a particular area of Flutter or a solution to a particular issue is important to you, consider reviewing open pull requests, trying them with your app, and providing any relevant feedback.

### Try out the beta channel

[#](#try-out-the-beta-channel)

To help ensure Flutter's stability and improve upcoming features, help test upcoming releases before they reach the stable channel.

Consider testing releases on the `beta` channel, both for general development and for testing compatibility with your apps.

Any feedback you have or regressions you encounter, make sure to [report them](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new/choose) to the Flutter team.

To get started, [switch](/install/upgrade#change-channels) to the [`beta` channel](/install/upgrade#the-beta-channel) today and account for any [necessary migrations](/release/breaking-changes).
