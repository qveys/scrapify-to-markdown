Summary
-------

[#](#summary)

The Material library has been updated to match the Material 3 Design spec. Changes include new components and component themes, updated component visuals, and much more. Many of these updates are seamless. You'll see the new version of an affected widget when recompiling your app against the 3.16 (or later) release. But some manual work is also required to complete the migration.

Migration guide
---------------

[#](#migration-guide)

Prior to the 3.16 release, you could opt in to the Material 3 changes by setting the `useMaterial3` flag to true. As of the Flutter 3.16 release (November 2023), `useMaterial3` is true by default.

By the way, you *can* revert to Material 2 behavior in your app by setting the `useMaterial3` to `false`. However, this is just a temporary solution. The `useMaterial3` flag *and* the Material 2 implementation will eventually be removed as part of Flutter's deprecation policy.

### Colors

[#](#colors)

The default values for `ThemeData.colorScheme` are updated to match the Material 3 Design spec.

The `ColorScheme.fromSeed` constructor generates a `ColorScheme` derived from the given `seedColor`. The colors generated by this constructor are designed to work well together and meet contrast requirements for accessibility in the Material 3 Design system.

When updating to the 3.16 release, your UI might look a little strange without the correct `ColorScheme`. To fix this, migrate to the `ColorScheme` generated from the `ColorScheme.fromSeed` constructor.

Code before migration:

dart

```
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.light(primary: Colors.blue),
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.blue),
),
```

To generate a content-based dynamic color scheme, use the `ColorScheme.fromImageProvider` static method. For an example of generating a color scheme, check out the [`ColorScheme` from a network image](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ColorScheme/fromImageProvider.html) sample.

Changes to Flutter Material 3 include a new background color. `ColorScheme.surfaceTint` indicates an elevated widget. Some widgets use different colors.

To return your app's UI to its previous behavior (which we don't recommend):

* Set `Colors.grey[50]!` to `ColorScheme.background` (when the theme is `Brightness.light`).* Set `Colors.grey[850]!`to `ColorScheme.background` (when the theme is `Brightness.dark`).

Code before migration:

dart

```
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple).copyWith(
    background: Colors.grey[50]!,
  ),
),
```

dart

```
darkTheme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: Colors.deepPurple,
    brightness: Brightness.dark,
  ).copyWith(background: Colors.grey[850]!),
),
```

The `ColorScheme.surfaceTint` value indicates a component's elevation in Material 3. Some widgets might use both `surfaceTint` and `shadowColor` to indicate elevation (for example, `Card` and `ElevatedButton`) and others might only use `surfaceTint` to indicate elevation (such as `AppBar`).

To return to the widget's previous behavior, set, set `Colors.transparent` to `ColorScheme.surfaceTint` in the theme. To differentiate a widget's shadow from the content (when it has no shadow), set the `ColorScheme.shadow` color to the `shadowColor` property in the widget theme without a default shadow color.

Code before migration:

dart

```
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple).copyWith(
    surfaceTint: Colors.transparent,
  ),
  appBarTheme: AppBarTheme(
   elevation: 4.0,
   shadowColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.shadow,
 ),
),
```

The `ElevatedButton` now styles itself with a new combination of colors. Previously, when the `useMaterial3` flag was set to false, `ElevatedButton` styled itself with `ColorScheme.primary` for the background and `ColorScheme.onPrimary` for the foreground. To achieve the same visuals, switch to the new `FilledButton` widget without the elevation changes or drop shadow.

Code before migration:

dart

```
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {},
  child: const Text('Button'),
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
    backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary,
    foregroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onPrimary,
  ),
  onPressed: () {},
  child: const Text('Button'),
),
```

### Typography

[#](#typography)

The default values for `ThemeData.textTheme` are updated to match the Material 3 defaults. Changes include updated font size, font weight, letter spacing, and line height. For more details, check out the [`TextTheme`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextTheme-class.html) documentation.

As shown in the following example, prior to the 3.16 release, when a `Text` widget with a long string using `TextTheme.bodyLarge` in a constrained layout wrapped the text into two lines. However, the 3.16 release wraps the text into three lines. If you must achieve the previous behavior, adjust the text style and, if necessary, the letter spacing.

Code before migration:

dart

```
ConstrainedBox(
  constraints: const BoxConstraints(maxWidth: 200),
    child: Text(
      'This is a very long text that should wrap to multiple lines.',
      style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyLarge,
  ),
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
ConstrainedBox(
  constraints: const BoxConstraints(maxWidth: 200),
    child: Text(
      'This is a very long text that should wrap to multiple lines.',
      style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium!.copyWith(
        letterSpacing: 0.0,
      ),
  ),
),
```

### Components

[#](#components)

Some components couldn't merely be updated to match the Material 3 Design spec but needed a whole new implementation. Such components require manual migration since the Flutter SDK doesn't know what, exactly, you want.

Replace the Material 2 style [`BottomNavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html) widget with the new [`NavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationBar-class.html) widget. It's slightly taller, contains pill-shaped navigation indicators, and uses new color mappings.

Code before migration:

dart

```
BottomNavigationBar(
  items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
    BottomNavigationBarItem(
      icon: Icon(Icons.home),
      label: 'Home',
    ),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(
      icon: Icon(Icons.business),
      label: 'Business',
    ),
    BottomNavigationBarItem(
      icon: Icon(Icons.school),
      label: 'School',
    ),
  ],
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
NavigationBar(
  destinations: const <Widget>[
    NavigationDestination(
      icon: Icon(Icons.home),
      label: 'Home',
    ),
    NavigationDestination(
      icon: Icon(Icons.business),
      label: 'Business',
    ),
    NavigationDestination(
      icon: Icon(Icons.school),
      label: 'School',
    ),
  ],
),
```

Check out the complete sample on [migrating from `BottomNavigationBar` to `NavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html#material.BottomNavigationBar.2).

Replace the [`Drawer`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Drawer-class.html) widget with [`NavigationDrawer`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/NavigationDrawer-class.html), which provides pill-shaped navigation indicators, rounded corners, and new color mappings.

Code before migration:

dart

```
Drawer(
  child: ListView(
    children: <Widget>[
      DrawerHeader(
        child: Text(
          'Drawer Header',
          style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge,
        ),
      ),
      ListTile(
        leading: const Icon(Icons.message),
        title: const Text('Messages'),
        onTap: () { },
      ),
      ListTile(
        leading: const Icon(Icons.account_circle),
        title: const Text('Profile'),
        onTap: () {},
      ),
      ListTile(
        leading: const Icon(Icons.settings),
        title: const Text('Settings'),
        onTap: () { },
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
NavigationDrawer(
  children: <Widget>[
    DrawerHeader(
      child: Text(
        'Drawer Header',
        style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge,
      ),
    ),
    const NavigationDrawerDestination(
      icon: Icon(Icons.message),
      label: Text('Messages'),
    ),
    const NavigationDrawerDestination(
      icon: Icon(Icons.account_circle),
      label: Text('Profile'),
    ),
    const NavigationDrawerDestination(
      icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
      label: Text('Settings'),
    ),
  ],
),
```

Material 3 introduces medium and large app bars that display a larger headline before scrolling. Instead of a drop shadow, `ColorScheme.surfaceTint` color is used create a separation from the content when scrolling.

The following code demonstrates how to implement the medium app bar:

dart

```
CustomScrollView(
  slivers: <Widget>[
    const SliverAppBar.medium(
      title: Text('Title'),
    ),
    SliverToBoxAdapter(
      child: Card(
        child: SizedBox(
          height: 1200,
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(8, 100, 8, 100),
            child: Text(
              'Here be scrolling content...',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineSmall,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ],
),
```

There are now two types of [`TabBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TabBar-class.html) widgets: primary and secondary. Secondary tabs are used within a content area to further separate related content and establish hierarchy. Check out the [`TabBar.secondary`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TabBar/TabBar.secondary.html) example.

The new [`TabBar.tabAlignment`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TabBar/tabAlignment.html) property specifies the horizontal alignment of the tabs.

The following sample shows how to modify tab alignment in a scrollable `TabBar`:

dart

```
AppBar(
  title: const Text('Title'),
  bottom: const TabBar(
    tabAlignment: TabAlignment.start,
    isScrollable: true,
    tabs: <Widget>[
      Tab(
        icon: Icon(Icons.cloud_outlined),
      ),
      Tab(
        icon: Icon(Icons.beach_access_sharp),
      ),
      Tab(
        icon: Icon(Icons.brightness_5_sharp),
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

[`SegmentedButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SegmentedButton-class.html), an updated version of [`ToggleButtons`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ToggleButtons-class.html), uses fully rounded corners, differs in layout height and size, and uses a Dart `Set` to determine selected items.

Code before migration:

dart

```
enum Weather { cloudy, rainy, sunny }

ToggleButtons(
  isSelected: const [false, true, false],
  onPressed: (int newSelection) { },
  children: const <Widget>[
    Icon(Icons.cloud_outlined),
    Icon(Icons.beach_access_sharp),
    Icon(Icons.brightness_5_sharp),
  ],
),
```

Code after migration:

dart

```
enum Weather { cloudy, rainy, sunny }

SegmentedButton<Weather>(
  selected: const <Weather>{Weather.rainy},
  onSelectionChanged: (Set<Weather> newSelection) { },
  segments: const <ButtonSegment<Weather>>[
    ButtonSegment(
      icon: Icon(Icons.cloud_outlined),
      value: Weather.cloudy,
    ),
    ButtonSegment(
      icon: Icon(Icons.beach_access_sharp),
      value: Weather.rainy,
    ),
    ButtonSegment(
      icon: Icon(Icons.brightness_5_sharp),
      value: Weather.sunny,
    ),
  ],
),
```

#### New components

[#](#new-components)

* "Menu bars and cascading menus" provide a desktop-style menu system that is fully traversable with the mouse or keyboard. Menus are anchored by a [`MenuBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MenuBar-class.html) or a [`MenuAnchor`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MenuAnchor-class.html). The new menu system isn't something that existing applications must migrate to, however applications that are deployed on the web or on desktop platforms should consider using it instead of `PopupMenuButton` (and related) classes.* [`DropdownMenu`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/DropdownMenu-class.html) combines a text field and a menu to produce what's sometimes called a *combo box*. Users can select a menu item from a potentially large list by entering a matching string or by interacting with the menu with touch, mouse, or keyboard. This can be a good replacement for `DropdownButton` widget, although it isn't necessary.* [`SearchBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchBar-class.html) and [`SearchAnchor`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchAnchor-class.html) are for interactions where the user enters a search query, the app computes a list of matching responses, and then the user either selects one or adjusts the query.* [`Badge`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Badge-class.html) decorates its child with a small label of just a few characters. Like '+1'. Badges are typically used to decorate the icon within a `NavigationDestination`, a `NavigationRailDestination`, A `NavigationDrawerDestination`, or a button's icon, as in `TextButton.icon`.* [`FilledButton`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FilledButton-class.html) and [`FilledButton.tonal`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FilledButton/FilledButton.tonal.html) are very similar to an `ElevatedButton` without the elevation changes and drop shadow.* [`FilterChip.elevated`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/FilterChip/FilterChip.elevated.html), [`ChoiceChip.elevated`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ChoiceChip/ChoiceChip.elevated.html), and [`ActionChip.elevated`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ActionChip/ActionChip.elevated.html) are elevated variants of the same chips with a drop shadow and a fill color.* [`Dialog.fullscreen`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Dialog/Dialog.fullscreen.html) fills the entire screen and typically contains a title, an action button, and a close button at the top.
