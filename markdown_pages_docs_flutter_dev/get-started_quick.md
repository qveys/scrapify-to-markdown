Install and set up Flutter
--------------------------

[#](#install)

Now that you've installed Git and VS Code, follow these steps to use VS Code to install and set up Flutter.

*info* Download manually

If you prefer to manually install Flutter, follow the instructions in [Install Flutter manually](/install/manual).

1. ### Launch VS Code

   If not already open, open VS Code by searching for it with Spotlight or opening it manually from the directory where it's installed.- ### Add the Flutter extension to VS Code

     To add the Dart and Flutter extensions to VS Code, visit the [Flutter extension's marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter), then click **Install**. If prompted by your browser, allow it to open VS Code.- ### Install Flutter with VS Code

       1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

          Go to **View** > **Command Palette** or press `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`.- In the command palette, type `flutter`.- Select **Flutter: New Project**.- VS Code prompts you to locate the Flutter SDK on your computer. Select **Download SDK**.- When the **Select Folder for Flutter SDK** dialog displays, choose where you want to install Flutter.- Click **Clone Flutter**.

                    While downloading Flutter, VS Code displays this pop-up notification:

                    ```
                    Downloading the Flutter SDK. This may take a few minutes.
                    ```

                    This download takes a few minutes. If you suspect that the download has hung, click **Cancel** then start the installation again.- Click **Add SDK to PATH**.

                      When successful, a notification displays:

                      ```
                      The Flutter SDK was added to your PATH
                      ```

                      - VS Code might display a Google Analytics notice.

                        If you agree, click **OK**.- To ensure that Flutter is available in all terminals:
                          1. Close, then reopen all terminal windows.- Restart VS Code.- ### Troubleshoot installation issues

         If you encounter any issues during installation, check out [Flutter installation troubleshooting](/install/troubleshoot).

Test drive Flutter
------------------

[#](#test-drive)

Now that you've set up VS Code and Flutter, it's time to create an app and try out Flutter development!

1. ### Create a new Flutter app

   1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

      Go to **View** > **Command Palette** or press `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`.- In the command palette, start typing `flutter:`.

        VS Code should surface commands from the Flutter plugin.- Select the **Flutter: New Project** command.

          Your OS or VS Code might ask for access to your documents, agree to continue to the next step.- Choose the **Application** template.

            VS Code should prompt you with **Which Flutter template?**. Choose **Application** to bootstrap a simple counter app.- Create or select the parent directory for your new app's folder.

              A file dialog should appear.
              1. Select or create the parent directory where you want the project to be created.- To confirm your selection, click **Select a folder to create the project in**.- Enter a name for your app.

                VS Code should prompt you to enter a name for your new app. Enter `trying_flutter` or a similar `lowercase_with_underscores` name. To confirm your selection, press `Enter`.- Wait for project initialization to complete.

                  Task progress is often surfaced as a notification in the bottom right and can also be accessed from the **Output** panel.- Open the `lib` directory, then the `main.dart` file.

                    If you're curious about what each portion of the code does, check out the preceding comments throughout the file.- ### Run your app on the web

     While Flutter apps can run on many platforms, try running your new app on the web.
     1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

        Go to **View** > **Command Palette** or press `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`.- In the command palette, start typing `flutter:`.

          VS Code should surface commands from the Flutter plugin.- Select the **Flutter: Select Device** command.- From the **Select Device** prompt, select **Chrome**.- Run or start debugging your app.

                Go to **Run** > **Start Debugging** or press `F5`.

                `flutter run` is used to build and start your app, then a new instance of Chrome should open and start running your newly created app.- ### Try hot reload

       Flutter offers a fast development cycle with **stateful hot reload**, the ability to reload the code of a live running app without restarting or losing app state.

       You can change your app's source code, run the hot reload command in VS Code, then see the change in your running app.
       1. In the running app, try adding to the counter a few times by clicking the ![increment (+)](/assets/images/docs/get-started/increment-button.png) button.- With your app still running, make a change in the `lib/main.dart` file.

            Change the `_counter++` line in the `_incrementCounter` method to instead decrement the `_counter` field.

            dart

            ```
            setState(() {
              // ...
              _counter++;
              _counter--;
            });
            ```

            - Save your changes (**File** > **Save All**) or click the **Hot Reload** ![hot reload icon](/assets/images/docs/get-started/hot-reload.svg) button.

              Flutter updates the running app without losing any existing state. Notice the existing value stayed the same.- Try clicking the ![increment (+)](/assets/images/docs/get-started/increment-button.png) button again. Notice the value decreases instead of increases.- ### Explore the Flutter sidebar

         The Flutter plugin adds a dedicated sidebar to VS Code for managing Flutter debug sessions and devices, viewing an outline of your code and widgets, as well as accessing the Dart and Flutter DevTools.
         1. If your app isn't running, start debugging it again.

            Go to **Run** > **Start Debugging** or press `F5`.- Open the Flutter sidebar in VS Code.

              Either open it with the Flutter ![Flutter logo](/assets/images/branding/flutter/logo/square.svg) button in the VS Code sidebar or open it from the command palette by running the **Flutter: Focus on Flutter Sidebar View** command.- If your app isn't running, start debugging it again.

                Go to **Run** > **Start Debugging** or press `F5`.- In the Flutter sidebar, under **DevTools**, click the **Flutter Inspector** button.

                  A separate **Widget Inspector** panel should open in VS Code.

                  In the widget inspector, you can view your app's widget tree, view the properties and layout of each widget, and more.- In the widget inspector, try clicking the top-level `MyHomePage` widget.

                    A view of its properties and layout should open, and the VS Code editor should navigate to and focus the line where the widget was included.- Explore and try out other features in the widget inspector and Flutter sidebar.
