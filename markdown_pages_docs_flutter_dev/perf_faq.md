Performance FAQ
===============

1. [Performance](/perf) chevron\_right- [Performance FAQ](/perf/faq)

This page collects some frequently asked questions about evaluating and debugging Flutter's performance.

* Which performance dashboards have metrics that are related to Flutter?
  + [Flutter dashboard on appspot](https://flutter-dashboard.appspot.com/)+ [Flutter Skia dashboard](https://flutter-flutter-perf.skia.org/t/?subset=regressions)+ [Flutter Engine Skia dashboard](https://flutter-engine-perf.skia.org/t/?subset=regressions)

* How do I add a benchmark to Flutter?
  + [How to write a render speed test for Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/testing/How-to-write-a-render-speed-test-for-Flutter.md)+ [How to write a memory test for Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/docs/contributing/testing/How-to-write-a-memory-test-for-Flutter.md)

* What are some tools for capturing and analyzing performance metrics?
  + [Dart/Flutter DevTools](/tools/devtools)+ [Apple instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruments_(software))+ [Linux perf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux))+ [Chrome tracing (enter `about:tracing` in your Chrome URL field)](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool)+ [Android systrace (`adb systrace`)](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/systrace)+ [Fuchsia `fx traceutil`](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/tracing/usage-guide)+ [Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/)+ [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/)

* My Flutter app looks janky or stutters. How do I fix it?
  + [Improving rendering performance](/perf/rendering-performance)

* What are some costly performance operations that I need to be careful with?
  + [`Opacity`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Opacity-class.html), [`Clip.antiAliasWithSaveLayer`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Clip.html#antiAliasWithSaveLayer), or anything that triggers [`saveLayer`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/Canvas/saveLayer.html)+ [`ImageFilter`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/ImageFilter-class.html)+ Also see [Performance best practices](/perf/best-practices)

* How do I tell which widgets in my Flutter app are rebuilt in each frame?
  + Set [`debugProfileBuildsEnabled`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/debugProfileBuildsEnabled.html) true in [widgets/debug.dart](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/debug.dart).+ Alternatively, change the `performRebuild` function in [widgets/framework.dart](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/framework.dart) to ignore `debugProfileBuildsEnabled` and always call `Timeline.startSync(...)/finish`.+ If you use IntelliJ, a GUI view of this data is available. Select **Track widget rebuilds**, and your IDE displays which the widgets rebuild.

* How do I query the target frames per second (of the display)?
  + [Get the display refresh rate](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/engine/src/flutter/docs/Engine-specific-Service-Protocol-extensions.md#get-the-display-refresh-rate-_fluttergetdisplayrefreshrate)

* How to solve my app's poor animations caused by an expensive Dart async function call that is blocking the UI thread?
  + Spawn another isolate using the [`compute()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/compute-constant.html) method, as demonstrated in [Parse JSON in the background](/cookbook/networking/background-parsing) cookbook.

* How do I determine my Flutter app's package size that a user will download?
  + See [Measuring your app's size](/perf/app-size)

* How do I see the breakdown of the Flutter engine size?
  + Visit the [binary size dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/flutter/241c87ad800beeab545ab867354d4683d5bfb6ce/android-arm-release/sizes/index.html), and replace the git hash in the URL with a recent commit hash from [Flutter's GitHub commits](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commits/main).

* How can I take a screenshot of an app that is running and export it as a SKP file?
  + Run `flutter screenshot --type=skia --observatory-uri=...`+ Note a known issue viewing screenshots:
      - [Issue 21237](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21237): Doesn't record images in real devices.+ To analyze and visualize the SKP file, check out the [Skia WASM debugger](https://debugger.skia.org/).

* How do I retrieve the shader persistent cache from a device?
  + On Android, you can do the following:

    ```
    adb shell
    run-as <com.your_app_package_name>
    cp <your_folder> <some_public_folder, e.g., /sdcard> -r
    adb pull <some_public_folder/your_folder>
    ```* How do I perform a trace in Fuchsia?
    + See [Fuchsia tracing guidelines](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/tracing/usage-guide)
